<h2>Preface</h2>


<p>The editor takes great pleasure in being
able to give to the public another
volume from the pen of the lamented
author&mdash;Myrtle Reed. These fascinating
bits of fiction reflect the characteristics of
the writer; the same vivid imagination, the
quick transition from pathos to humour,
the facility of utterance, the wholesome
sentiment, the purity of thought, the delicacy
of touch, the spontaneous wit which
endeared her to friends and to thousands of
readers, not only in Europe and America,
but also in Australia and South Africa, are
here fully represented.</p>

<p>Her mission was largely one of comfort
to the suffering and the sorrowing; letters
of good cheer went to far-away countries
where her personal ministry could reach
in no other way, and her writings are rich
with sympathy and hope which have
poured the oil of gladness into many a
wounded spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>Pathos is not sadness, but it is rather the
sunshine gleaming through a passing cloud,
and hence the writings of Myrtle Reed are
illumined with the gladsome light of unfailing
love. Not only in her books and in
letters to troubled souls, but also in her
personal records, we find the unfading
lines of a deeply devotional nature which
was sacredly guarded from the careless
observer and seldom discussed even with
friends. But in this abiding faith was
rooted the brave loyalty and high purpose
which not only characterised herself, but
also all of her productions.</p>

<p>The beautiful stories here presented have
given pleasure to thousands of readers in
the magazines in which they first came into
print, and it is to the unvarying courtesy of
the publishers that we are indebted for the
privilege of thus binding the scattered
grain into a single golden sheaf.</p>

<p>For the many letters of sincere sympathy
which, in response to a formal request, have
come from these stranger-friends, the editor
is especially grateful.</p>

The magic East lies in enchanted shadow&mdash;<br />
A Titan dreaming fitfully of day,<br />
The ghostly mists are deep upon the meadow<br />
Outlined against the hillside faintly grey;<br />
The portent of the dawn has strangely swayed<br />
The silver birches, trembling and afraid.<br />
Too long the hosts of Dark have held the plain,<br />
The King of Night at last must end his reign;<br />
With rapturous accord doth earth acclaim<br />
The tidings of new life for heart and brain,<br />
Behold the night hath passed away in flame!<br />
<br />
Sea-born and strong, the winds begin to blow<br />
Against the cliffs, the billows break in spray;<br />
Returning waters meet and overflow&mdash;<br />
White-plumed battalions marshalled for the fray;<br />
Upon the beach the foaming cavalcade<br />
Beats yet once more with rhythmic cannonade.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>Afar the boundless reaches of the main<br />
Show lines of white that fall and rise again,<br />
A morning song the sea's lips soon shall frame,<br />
Insistent and with passionate refrain,<br />
Behold the night hath passed away in flame!<br />
Athwart the sombre East there comes a glow&mdash;<br />
A thrill, a tremble, then a slender ray,<br />
A single arrow from the sun-god's bow<br />
Strikes on the zenith like a star astray;<br />
Swiftly does the light of Venus fade,<br />
Her gentle radiance for the night was made.<br />
The distant hills take on a crimson stain<br />
From fire-poppies set in golden grain<br />
That wrought of light puts harvest fields to shame;<br />
Through feathery clouds there creeps a scarlet vein,<br />
Behold the night hath passed away in flame!<br />
<br />
The ramparts of the sunrise glorious grow,<br />
Of what lost rubies builded, none may say,<br />
What diamonds snatched from sunbeams or from snow&mdash;<br />
What emeralds and violets lost by May<br />
In those far off celestial walls are laid!<br />
Imperial columns of jacinth and of jade,<br />
Like dreamer's castles built in sunny Spain,<br />
Before these jewelled entrances are lain;<br />
Forgotten springs may summer now reclaim<br />
And visions of the autumn yet remain,<br />
Behold the night hath passed away in flame!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>Reflected splendour on the sea below<br />
Hath blazoned through the waves a royal way&mdash;<br />
A path of glory such as angels know,<br />
That leads the wondering soul to kneel and pray.<br />
Stray threads of sun are shining in the glade,<br />
Where dews of morning sparkle in the shade<br />
The pearly webs an alien beauty gain;<br />
High in the maple, down the leafy lane,<br />
A robin's song with neither words nor name<br />
Falls in a cadence like a silver rain,<br />
Behold the night hath passed away in flame!<br />

<h2>The White Shield</h2>


<p>People said that Joe Hayward's pictures
"lacked something." Even the
critics, who know everything, were at a
loss to find where the deficiency might be.
Hayward, himself, worked hard studying
the masters, patiently correcting faults
in colour and perspective, and succeeding
after a fashion. But he felt that art,
in its highest and best sense, was utterly
beyond him; there was a haunting elusive
something which was continually beyond
his reach.</p>

<p>Occasionally, when he sold a picture, he
would give "a time" to a dozen artist
chums from studios near by, as they did,
whenever fortune favoured them; after this
he would paint again, on and on, with a
really tremendous perseverance.</p>

<p>At length, he obtained permission to
make an exhibition of his work in a single
room at the Art Gallery. The pictures
were only ten in number, and some of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
were small, but they represented a year's
hard work. When he superintended the
hanging, on Saturday morning, he was
more nearly happy than he had ever been
in his life. The placard on the door,
"The Hayward Exhibition will open Monday,"
filled him with pleasure. It was not
a conceited feeling of importance, but
rather a happy consciousness that he had
done his best.</p>

<p>At last he was suited with the arrangement.
The men went out with the ladder
and wire, and he stood in the centre of
the room, contemplating the result. The
landscape in the corner might be a little
out of drawing, he thought, but the
general public would not notice that.
And the woman in white, beside it,
which he had christened <i>Purity</i> certainly
showed to good advantage. He
remembered very well the day he had put
the finishing touches upon it after the night
of revelry in which he had helped Jennings
and a dozen other fellows from neighbouring
studios to celebrate the sale of Jennings'
<i>Study of a Head</i>, and how he had
thought, at the time, that he, who spent
such nights, had no business to paint a
figure like this of <i>Purity</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>As he turned to leave the room, he saw a
grey gowned young woman, who evidently
did not know that the pictures were not
as yet upon public view. She passed him
as she came in, with a rustle of silken
skirts and a cooling odour of violets. Seeing
the key of the room in his hand, she
turned to him and said: "Pardon me,
but can you tell me whose pictures these
are?"</p>

<p>"These are Hayward's," he replied.</p>

<p>"Hayward," she repeated after him, as
if the name were wholly new to her.</p>

<p>"Hayward is a young artist and of
purely local reputation," he explained.
"This is his first public exhibition."</p>

<p>She surveyed the collection without any
very strong show of pleasure, until he
remarked, "You don't seem to think much
of his beginning."</p>

<p>She was prompt in her answer: "No, I
do not, they seem to lack something."</p>

<p>He sighed inwardly. That old, old,
"something." Hayward's pictures all
lacked "something" as everybody said of
them; but what that something was, his
intimates, his fellow artists, were not the
kind to know.</p>

<p>"What is it, do you think?" he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know," she replied slowly.
"If one knew the man, one might be able
to tell."</p>

<p>For the first time she looked him full
in the face. He saw nothing but her
eyes, clear and honest, reading him through
and through.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, "if you knew the
man, I think you could tell."</p>

<p>"I'm not at all sure," she laughed,
"It's only a fancy of mine."</p>

<p>Drawing a watch from her belt, she
looked surprised and turned away. He
listened until the silken rustle had completely
ceased. Then he, too, went out
and on the stair he found a fine handkerchief
edged with lace, delicately scented
with violet, and minutely marked in the
corner: "Constance Grey."</p>

<p>On Sunday night, the studio building
where Hayward and others painted glowed
with light. The morrow's opening of
"The Hayward Exhibition" was being
celebrated with "a time" at the expense
of the artist. Glasses clinked, and the
air was heavy with smoke, two women from
a vaudeville theatre, near by made merry
upon an impromptu stage.</p>

<p>Everybody seemed to be happy except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Hayward. The owner of the handkerchief
was in his mind. He felt that those eyes
of hers grey, deep, and tender, though
they were, might blaze with anger at a
scene like this. The handkerchief had no
place in such an atmosphere. He went
over to his book case, and put it between
the leaves of his Tennyson, smiling as he
caught the words on the opposite page:</p>

<div class="poem">
"A man had given all other bliss<br />
And all his worldly worth for this,<br />
To waste his whole heart in one kiss<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Upon her perfect lips."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Her handkerchief would feel more at
home there, he thought, though as he
closed the book, he could not help wondering
what she would say if she looked into
the room.</p>

<p>A quick eye had followed his movement,
and soon afterward its owner, Jennings,
took occasion to examine the volume.
He waved the handkerchief aloft triumphantly.
"Heigho, fellows! Hayward's
got a new mark for his clothes! Look here&mdash;'Constance
Grey'!" Hayward was
shaken with mingled shame and anger
that he could not explain, even to himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
The words and tone with which he commanded
his friend to put the little thing
back where he had found it were as hot as
they were foolish. For a moment the two
men faced each other; then Jennings apologised,
and afterward Hayward murmured
a sort of apology also. In sparkling champagne
they drank to good fellowship again.
But the incident was not without a certain
subtle effect upon the celebration, and at
one o'clock Hayward sat alone with his
face buried in his hands, a dainty handkerchief
spread out before him, and beside it
was the rapidly sketched outline of a face
which he had just completed.</p>

<p>He knew now why the action of Jennings
had made him so furious. The shaft of
light from a woman's eyes, which once
strikes deep into the soul of every man,
had at last come home to him.</p>

<p>The "opening" was auspicious. Wealth
and art alike were well represented. One
of his most important pictures was marked
"sold" before the evening was over, and
everybody congratulated the artist upon
his good fortune. In praise of his art,
however, very little was said that did not
somehow carry in it, perhaps silently, the
old drawback&mdash;the implication that something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
was lacking; still exultation ran rife
in his veins. There were throngs of beautiful
women there and he was the centre
of it all.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the evening, a lady
who had once sat for a portrait came up to
him. She was one of a little group who
came in late after a theatre party, but she
approached with the air of an old friend.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hayward," she said, "I want you
to know my niece."</p>

<p>He followed her into the next room
where a young lady sat upon a divan. Her
grey eyes were lifted to his face, and then
suddenly lowered in confusion.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hayward," she said, "I am so
ashamed!" And when he tried to reassure
her, she answered: "Let's not talk about
it&mdash;it's too humiliating!"</p>

<p>So they spoke of other things. He
learned that she had come from a distant
city to visit relatives, and the aunt invited
him to call upon them. Friday afternoon
came at last, when Miss Grey and her aunt
were at home. Other Fridays followed,
and other days which served as well as
Fridays. It was seldom that the girl
looked him in the face; but when she did
so, he felt himself confessed before her&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
man with no right to touch even the hem of
her garment, yet honouring her with every
fibre of his being.</p>

<p>They were much together and Constance
took a frank enjoyment in his friendship.
He made every effort to please her, and
one day they went into the country.</p>

<p>Constance was almost childishly happy,
but the seeming perfection of her happiness
distressed him when he learned that in a
very few days she was to sail for Europe,
pass the summer and autumn in travel,
and spend the winter in Paris.</p>

<p>At length they sat down under a gnarled
oak tree and watched the light upon the
river and in the sky. After an embarrassing
silence Hayward spoke:</p>

<p>"I think you know the man now,&mdash;will
you tell me what you think of his pictures?"</p>

<p>She hesitated. "I do not know the man
well enough to say, but I will give you my
art creed, and let you judge for yourself.
I believe that a man's art is neither more
nor less than the expression of himself, and
that, in order to obtain an exalted expression,
his first business is with himself.
Wrong living blunts, and eventually
destroys, the fundamental sense of right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and wrong without which a noble art is
impossible. When a man's art is true, it
is because he himself is true. The true
artist must be a man first, and an artist
afterward."</p>

<p>Hayward took her admonition with the
meekness becoming his position as her
worshipper. The conversation ended with
his declaration that he would not paint
again until he had something in himself
which was worthy of being put into his
picture.</p>

<p>"You'll help me, won't you?" he asked.</p>

<p>Her eyes filled. "Indeed I will, if I only
can."</p>

<p>He went home with love's fever in his
veins. She had promised to help him, and
surely there was only one way. He wrote
her an ardent note, and an hour later his
messenger brought her reply.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Believe me, I never dreamed of this,
and you know what my answer must be;
but I do not need to tell you that whatever
sincere and honest friendship can offer is
already yours.</p>

<div class="right">
"With deep regret, I am as ever,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Constance Grey</span>."<br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>The grim humour of the thing stunned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
him momentarily and he laughed harshly.
Then he flung himself down in a passion of
grief. In the morning he took pen and
paper again, after a night of sleepless distress.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"You cannot mean what you say. That
white womanly soul of yours must wake
to love me some day. You have stood
between me and the depths, and there has
been no shame in the life that I offer you,
since you came into it.</p>

<p>"Oh, you perfect thing, you perfect
thing, you don't know what you are
to me! Constance, let me come!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer was promptly forthcoming:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I cannot promise what you ask, but
you may come and see me if you wish."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pale with expectancy, Hayward was only
the ghost of himself when the servant
admitted him. He had waited but a
moment when Constance entered the room
wearing the gown in which he had first
seen her. He rose to meet her, but she
came and sat down by his side.</p>

<p>"Listen," she said, "and I will tell you
how I feel. I am twenty-five and I have
never 'cared.' I do not believe that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
ever shall care, for the love that we read of
is almost incomprehensible to me. You
cannot marry such a woman."</p>

<p>His answer was fervent, his words
crowded one upon another in a vehement
flood, and his voice was low and hoarse
with pent-up emotion, as he implored her
to believe in him, trust him, and be his
wife,&mdash;kneeling at her feet and kissing her
hands in abject humility.</p>

<p>It was very hard for her to say what she
must, but with an effort she rose and drew
away from him.</p>

<p>"I must be true to myself and to you,"
she said, "and I can say nothing but the
old bitter No."</p>

<p>White and wretched, he went away,
leaving her white and wretched behind
him.</p>

<p>For days and weeks thereafter, Hayward
painted busily. Jennings went to see him
one afternoon.</p>

<p>"Look here, old fellow," he said,
"what's the matter? I know I was ungentlemanly
about the handkerchief, but
that's no reason why you should cut us
all this way. Can't you forget about it?"</p>

<p>"Why, Jennings, old boy, I haven't cut
anybody."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, but you've tired of us, and you
can't hide it. Come down the river with
us to-night. The fellows have got a yacht,
and we'll have supper on board with
plenty of champagne. Won't you come?"</p>

<p>Hayward was seriously tempted. He
knew what "the time" would mean&mdash;the
ecstasy of it and the dull penalties which
would follow. But that day by the river
came into his memory: a sweet sunlit
face, and a woman's voice saying to him:
"When a man's art is true, it is because he
himself is true."</p>

<p>"Jennings," he said, "do I look like a
man who would make good company at a
champagne supper? You know what's
the matter with me. Why don't you just
sensibly drop me?"</p>

<p>Jennings begged, and mocked, and bullied,
all in a good-natured way, but his
friend was firm. When he went out, Hayward
locked the studio door and drew
his half finished picture from behind a
screen.</p>

<p>"She was right," he said to himself.</p>

<p>Constance sailed. He dreamed of his
picture as being hung in the Salon, and of
her seeing it there. By and by it was
finished, but the artist's strength was gone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and his physician ordered him away from
his work.</p>

<p>When he returned, restored to health,
the picture was placed on exhibition.
Crowds thronged the gallery, columns and
pages were written in its praise, and
astonishing prices were offered for it, but
the picture was not for sale. It, too,
crossed the water, and the dream which
had comforted him for many months at
last came true.</p>

<p>When Constance looked upon Hayward's
painting, her heart leaped as if it
would leave her breast. White, radiant,
and glorified, it was she herself who stood
in the centre of the canvas. That self-reliant,
fearless pose seemed to radiate
infinite calm. Behind her raged the powers
of darkness, utterly helpless to pass the
line on which she stood. Her face seemed
to illumine the shadows around her; her
figure was instinct with grace and strength.
Below the picture was the name: <i>The
White Shield</i>.</p>

<p>The beauty of the conception dawned
upon her slowly. Pale and trembling, she
stood there, forgetful of the place, and the
throng around her. At length she knew
what she meant to him; that his art at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
last rang true because he had loved her
enough to be a man for her sake.</p>

<p>She dared not linger before it then, but
she came again when the place was empty,
and stood before her lover's work, like one
in a dream. The fiends in the shadow
showed her the might of the temptations
he had fought down. She gazed at her
own glorified face until her eyes filled with
tears. With a great throb which was
almost pain, Constance woke to the knowledge
that she loved him, even as he loved
her&mdash;well enough to stand between him
and danger till she herself should fall.</p>

<p>The old grey guard, passing through the
room, saw her upturned face in that
moment of exaltation. It was the same
that he saw in the picture above, and he
quietly went away to wait until Constance
came out, her face flushed and her eyes
shining like stars, before he locked the door.</p>

<p>That night the cable trembled with a
message to America. It reached Hayward
the next morning as he sat reading the
daily paper. The envelope fluttered unheeding
to the floor, and his face grew
tender then radiant as he read the few
words which told him that his picture had
rewarded his love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait," he said to the messenger boy.
Hurriedly he wrote the answer: "Sailing
next steamer"&mdash;then, utterly oblivious of
the additional expense, he added another
word, which must have been very expressive,
for Constance turned crimson when
it reached her&mdash;perhaps because the discerning
genius who copies cablegrams in
typewriting had put the last word in
capitals, thinking that the message came
from a Mr. Darling.</p>

<h2>An International Affair</h2>


<p>The Committee of Literary Extension
was holding its first meeting. Five
girls sat around a glowing gas log and
nibbled daintily at some chocolates which
had been sent to the hostess.</p>

<p>"Come, Margaret, you're the chairman
of this committee; please tell us what it
is all for," suggested Grace Hayes.</p>

<p>"Well, girls, I hardly know how to
begin. Most of us in travelling have seen
those little huts along the railroad with a
little bit of cultivated ground around each
one. They are the very embodiment of
desolation. I have seen whole families
come out to stare at the train as it whirled
by, and I have often wondered what place
there could be for such people in this
beautiful, happy world&mdash;why I should have
my books and friends and the thousand
other things that have been given to me,
while other people, and worst of all, other
women, have to live lives like that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are boys upon farms, in reform
schools, and in little towns who scarcely
ever see even a newspaper, and who do not
know what a magazine is.</p>

<p>"It is to reach this class of people that
this work has been undertaken, and for
this purpose our committee has been
appointed. Fifteen or twenty magazines
and illustrated papers come to us every
month&mdash;even to the few who are here
to-day: perhaps some of you see even
more than this. After we have read them,
we might send them to these people
instead of burning them, and who can tell
how many starving minds we may
make better, and happier, in this simple
way, and with very little effort on our
part?"</p>

<p>"Can they read?" It was Grace, an
always practical individual, who spoke.</p>

<p>"If they can't, they can learn," responded
Miss Stone. "It will be an incentive
to their best efforts in every way."</p>

<p>Katherine Bryant leaned forward, her
face flushed, and her eyes shining. "Girls,"
she said, "it's perfectly beautiful. We'll
send all of our own magazines and illustrated
papers, all we can collect from
other sources, and we'll raise money to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
buy new ones. I don't know of any other
way in which we can do so much good."</p>

<p>Plan after plan was suggested, and at
last it was decided that the committee
should write to a society in Boston which
did similar work, and ask for the names
and addresses of twenty-five persons who
were in need of reading matter. These
could be removed from the lists of the
Boston society, as the Committee on Literary
Extension of the Detroit Young
Woman's Club would attend to their needs
in future.</p>

<p>In due time the list arrived, with a few
particulars opposite each name. The committee
was again called together, and the
chairman gave each girl five names.</p>

<p>"Katherine dear," she said, "there are
some more names in the little note-book
that is up-stairs in my desk. They are all
boys who have left the reform school. A
friend of mine, who is one of the directors,
gave them to me, and there are only four
or five. Would you mind taking those in
addition to your own?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," and Katherine ran up to
Margaret's desk.</p>

<p>"Wonder where she keeps her note-book!
Oh, here it is, and here is the list."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
She copied busily. "One, two, three, four;
that's all. No, here's another on the next
page," and at the end of her slip she wrote:
"Robert Ross, Athol, Spink Co., South
Dakota." The work was taken up in earnest
and many magazines were collected
within the next few days. A strict account
was kept of everything sent out, and
occasionally the girls met to compare
notes.</p>

<p>Margaret came home one day and found
Mrs. Boyce waiting for her. "My dear,"
said the lady, "I've lost an address that
troubles me, and I think it may have been
on the card that I gave you the other day."</p>

<p>"I'll see," replied Margaret, "I copied
them all that very afternoon." She took
her note-book out of her chatelaine bag
and handed it to Mrs. Boyce. "Which one
is it?"</p>

<p>The elder lady laughed in a relieved way.
"This last one," she answered. "Robert
Ross. He's my favourite nephew, off on
a shooting trip, and he wants me to write
to him. He'd never forgive me, if I didn't.
Just give me a card, and I will try not to be
so careless again."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Katherine was absorbed in
addressing magazines with great vigour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
She had found a pile of back numbers in
the attic and was trying to divide them
properly. The household journals went
to a woman in Kansas, fifty miles from a
city, others she mailed to a boy of sixteen
who was on a farm in Minnesota, and a
copy of a popular magazine was addressed
to Mr. Robert Ross. At the top of each
one she had written, "From Miss Katherine
Bryant, Jefferson Ave., Detroit."</p>

<p>A short time afterward, she received a
pathetic letter from the woman to whom
she had sent the household magazines.
"I married for love," she wrote, "and have
never been sorry, but I miss many of the
things to which I was accustomed in my
eastern home. A magazine is an unusual
thing upon a Kansas farm, and with all
my heart I thank you for the great pleasure
you have given a lonely woman."</p>

<p>Mindful of the fact that one of the objects
of the committee was to get into
correspondence with its beneficiaries, Katherine
sat down to write an encouraging
note to her and also to others, but before
she had finished the postman brought
another letter.</p>

<p>It had been mailed in South Dakota.
The paper was the white ruled variety, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
be found in country stores, but the penmanship
was clear and business-like.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"My dear Miss Bryant," the letter
began, "I am sure I don't know what good
angel possessed you to send me a copy of
my favourite magazine, but I am none the
less grateful and only too happy to acknowledge
it. I am hurt, but the doctor thinks
not seriously, and that I shall be all right
in a few weeks. The magazine which you
so kindly sent has given me the first
pleasant day I have had for some time.</p>

<p>"I should be most happy to receive a
letter from you, but of course that is too
much for a stranger to ask, even though he
be ill and alone.</p>

<div class="right">
"Sincerely and gratefully yours,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Robert Ross</span>."<br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Katherine knit her pretty brows, and
read it over again. "It's no queerer than
the one I got from the Kansas woman,"
she decided. "At any rate, they both
seem glad to get them and they shall have
some more."</p>

<p>She wrote very kindly to Robert Ross,
inquiring into the particulars of his injury,
and whether or not he lived on a farm.
She said he was very fortunate, if he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
indeed live in the country, because so many
people were pining away and dying in the
great cities. The magazine she had sent
was one of her own favourites also, and she
would send the next number as soon as it
came out. In the meantime, she hoped
the package of papers she was sending in
the same mail would prove acceptable.</p>

<p>Out on the porch of the Athol House,
Mr. Ross sat in the sun and reviled
creation in general. It was a palatial
hotel&mdash;for that region&mdash;but he seemed
unmindful of his advantages.</p>

<p>"Oh, confound it," he groaned, "why
couldn't I have shot some other idiot instead
of myself? I ought not to be trusted
with a gun! Right in the height of the
prairie chicken season too, and those other
fellows, three of them, off bagging every bit
of the game! I hope they won't forget to
come back this way, and take me home
with them! Emperor, old fellow, it's hard
luck. Isn't it?"</p>

<p>The Irish setter, who had been addressed,
came and put his cold nose into Mr. Ross's
hand. The well-bred dog had refused to
desert his wounded master, even for the
charms of prairie chickens, and touched by
his dumb devotion Ross permitted him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
stay. Long conversations were held every
day, and Emperor told Ross as plainly as a
dog could, that if it hadn't been for that
dreadful flesh wound they would be having
a fine time in the fields, capturing more
game than any other dog and man in the
party.</p>

<p>When the landlord returned from the
post-office he brought a letter which Emperor
carried in triumph to his master.
Ross read it in surprise. Who Miss Bryant
might be, he did not know, but she wrote
a pleasant letter, and it was certainly kind
of her to notice him.</p>

<p>He decided that the letter he wrote in
acknowledgment of the magazine must
have been extremely well done. He thought
of the unknown fair one for some time, and
then concluded to write again. He was
non-committal about himself, fearing to
spoil any delusion she might have been
labouring under when she sent the magazine.</p>

<p>When Katherine received the second
letter, she felt several pricks of conscience.
It wasn't a nice thing she was doing, and
she knew it. But a person shouldn't let
squeamishness interfere with philanthropic
work, so she answered promptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>She drew him into a discussion of an
article on "The Desirability of Annexing
Canada to the United States," and he
criticised it harshly. He forgot to tell her
that he was a Canadian by birth and a
loyal subject of the King. His point of
view was naturally distorted, and she
replied with some spirit, dealing very
patiently, however, with the frail arguments
which he had submitted.</p>

<p>Katherine thought the discussion was a
good thing. Anything that would make
him think was an unmixed blessing. She
fairly glowed as she thought of the mental
stimulus she might give to this poor
Dakota farmer, who had been hurt in
some mysterious way, and her letters grew
longer even as they increased in frequency,
for Mr. Ross wrote very promptly indeed.
She could well understand that, when a
cripple had so little to occupy his time in
that far away wilderness.</p>

<p>Ross was highly amused. He admired
Miss Bryant's letters and wished he might
see Miss Bryant herself. A bright idea
(as he thought) occurred to him&mdash;why
not?</p>

<p>With very red cheeks, Miss Katherine
read the latest news from Spink County.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Her own beautiful Irish setter put his
head into her lap, and begged to be petted.</p>

<p>"Go away, Rex, I want to think. The
wretch! To ask for my photograph! He
evidently doesn't know his place! I'll
teach him where it is and then take the
name of the impertinent creature off my
list!"</p>

<p>She sat down to compose a letter which
should make Mr. Robert Ross, alias
wretch, squirm in agony. Rex was persistent
and put his paw up to shake hands.
Katherine turned and looked at him.</p>

<p>"You're a dreadfully nice doggie, but I
wish you'd go away and not bother me."</p>

<p>Then an idea came to her which startled
her at first, but grew more attractive as
she became better acquainted with it. She
bent down and whispered to Rex, and he
wagged his tail as if he fully understood.</p>

<p>"Yes, Rex, it's got to be done. I'm
sorry to sacrifice any of your beauty, but
you've got to get your mistress out of a
scrape. Come on!" And the willing Rex
was escorted into the back yard.</p>

<p>Sooner than he expected, Mr. Ross
found a letter at his plate when he limped
in to the customary breakfast of black
coffee and fried eggs. On this occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
he omitted the eggs and hastily swallowed
the coffee, for the envelope was addressed
in familiar style.</p>

<p>It was a very pleasant letter. The
writer seemed to meet his advances in a
proper spirit, but there was no photograph.
"I don't give my pictures to young men,
nor old ones either, but I enclose a lock of
hair which I have cut off on purpose for
you, and I hope you will be pleased with
it."</p>

<p>He looked at the enclosure again and
again. It was a single silky curl, of a
beautiful reddish gold, tied daintily with
blue ribbon. He certainly was pleased
with it, as she had hoped. "Hair like this
and violet eyes," soliloquised Ross. "I
must write again without delay." So when
the landlord went to the post-office he
mailed another letter to Miss Bryant. The
first page consisted wholly of raptures.</p>

<p>He began to think that Athol was not so
dull a place as he had at first imagined.
Those fellows off in the fields shooting
prairie chickens were not having any
better time than he and Emperor in this
thriving town. It was true that Emperor
slept most of the time, but magazines, and
papers, and letters not only made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
time less tedious, but there seemed to be
opening up a vista of romance which made
the tramping in the stubbly fields look very
much less attractive.</p>

<p>While he thought of it, he would read
Miss Bryant's letter again. He took it
out of the envelope, and the curl fell unnoticed
to the floor of what the landlord
was pleased to term "the front stoop."
Emperor walked over, and seemed interested.
His master did not notice him,
being absorbed in the letter; at last the
dog sniffed uneasily, and then growled, so
Ross looked up and was surprised to find
him pawing something vigorously. Still
Ross did not see what the dog had.
"What's the matter with you, old fellow?"
Emperor growled again, and bit
fiercely at the curl. Its owner rescued it
at once, but the dog would not be appeased.
He made such a fuss that his master put
the letter away. Then Emperor made another
attack on the curl, and Ross took it
away from him again and examined it
closely. A queer look came into his face
and a queerer note into his voice. "Emperor,
come here. Keep still."</p>

<p>The long golden fringe that made Emperor's
tail the thing of beauty that it was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
was drawn up on his knee and the curl was
laid beside it. There was no doubt at all.
It matched exactly. Ross leaned back in
his chair with a low whistle. "Well&mdash;by&mdash;Jove!
I wonder if she'll tell me when
she writes," he said to himself. With a
despairing grin, he remembered his raptures
on the subject and decided that Miss
Bryant would be very certain to tell him
where that "sweet curl" came from!</p>

<p>When the missive from Spink County
reached Detroit, Miss Katherine Bryant
was a very happy girl. As a rule, it takes
very little to make girls happy. For the
first time in her life, she longed for a confidant,
and unlike most girls, she had none.
She took Rex for a long walk and told him
all about it. The poor dismantled tail
wagged in ecstasy, but his mistress was
not sure that he understood the joke in its
entirety.</p>

<p>At last she would have her revenge and
she took keen delight in answering that
letter. "I quite agree with you concerning
the beauty of the hair," she wrote. "It
came from my beautiful Irish setter, and
I am very glad you are pleased with it,
though to tell the truth, I should think
you utterly heartless if you were not."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Ross sent an elaborate apology for his
impertinence, and confessed that he admired
her all the more for outwitting him.
Inwardly, he wished that Emperor had
made his discovery before he had mailed
that idiotic letter. His manliness, however,
appealed to Katherine and she did not take
his name off the list.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the three other men
returned to their wounded comrade. They
had been very successful and were profuse
in their expressions of regret. Ross said
nothing of his unknown friend. He felt
that it would not be fair to her, and anyhow,
when a girl has sent you dog-hair,
and you have raved over it, it isn't best
to tell of it. He was sure that all the
circumstances were in favour of his keeping
still about it.</p>

<p>The ugly wound had quite healed when
the four men started East together. At
St. Paul they separated, Ross and Emperor
taking the night train for Detroit
and the promised visit to Mrs. Boyce.</p>

<p>She was delighted to see her nephew, and
Emperor soon found his way into her good
graces. His master took him out for a
stroll the same day he arrived, the dog
having been long confined in a box-car,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and the released captive found his excursion
especially refreshing. At a corner,
however, he met another Irish setter, also
out for a stroll, and the two speedily
entered into a violent discussion.</p>

<p>A snarling, rolling, mahogany-coloured
ball rolled toward Ross, and a young lady
followed, crying at the top of her voice,
"Rex! Rex! Come here."</p>

<p>The owner of Emperor rushed into the
disturbance with his cane, and succeeded
in resolving the ball into its component
parts.</p>

<p>Rex, panting and injured, was restored
to his agitated mistress, while Emperor
chafed at his master's restraining hand.</p>

<p>Apologies were profuse on both sides.
"I'm stronger than you," Ross said, "and
if you can hold your dog until I get mine
out of sight, we shall have no more
trouble."</p>

<p>Miss Bryant scolded Rex until his head
and tail drooped with shame, and relentlessly
kept him at heel all the way
home.</p>

<p>At her own gate, she met Margaret
Stone, to whom she told the story of her
adventure with the handsome stranger,
and the other dog, who "looked so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
like Rex that his own mother could not
have told them apart!"</p>

<p>Margaret's errand was a brief one.
Mrs. Boyce was coming over to the Stone
mansion with her nephew and she wanted
Katherine to come to dinner and stay all
night. So Katherine put on her prettiest
gown and went over, little thinking what
fate had in store for her.</p>

<p>She instantly recognised in Ross the
man she had met a few hours before under
very different circumstances. He was too
much of a gentleman to allude to the
occurrence, but she flushed uncomfortably.</p>

<p>Both girls found him an exceedingly
pleasant fellow. Katherine had recovered
from her embarrassment, and was laughing
happily, when Mrs. Boyce began to speak
of the Committee on Literary Extension
and the good work the girls were doing.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Bob," she went on, "that
I nearly lost your address in that way? I
gave it to Margaret with the names of
some boys from the Reform School. It's a
blessed wonder you didn't get magazines
and tracts!"</p>

<p>If Robert had been an angel he would
not have looked at Katherine, but being
merely human he did. Miss Bryant rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
in a dignified manner. "Margaret," she
said unsteadily, "I must go home."</p>

<p>"Why, Katherine, you were going to
stay all night!"</p>

<p>"My&mdash;head&mdash;aches," she answered.</p>

<p>"Bob," commanded Mrs. Boyce, "you
must take Katherine home."</p>

<p>"It's not at all necessary," pleaded
Katherine piteously.</p>

<p>"But I insist," repeated Mrs. Boyce
with the utmost good will.</p>

<p>Mr. Ross rose. "If Miss Bryant will
permit me, I shall be only too glad to
accompany her home," he said courteously.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but submit
with the best grace she could assume. Once
out of doors, she was the first to break the
silence:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid to be out alone&mdash;in the
city."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied her escort cheerily, "it's
a pity you didn't bring your dog!" He
could have bitten his tongue out for making
such an unlucky speech, but to his surprise
Katherine broke down and sobbed
hysterically.</p>

<p>Mr. Ross took both her hands in his
own. "You are tired and nervous, Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Bryant, and I beg you to think no more
about what has happened. You have no
idea how much good you did me out in
that miserable little place, and I shall be
only too glad to be your friend, if you will
let me."</p>

<p>Katherine wiped her eyes: "If you can
be my friend, I ought to be very willing
to be yours," and just outside of her door
Canada and the United States clasped
hands in a solemn treaty of peace.</p>

<p>Safely in her own room, the mistress of
Rex sat down before the mirror and
studied her face attentively. "Katherine
Bryant," she said to herself, "you are an
idiot! Not foolish, nor silly, nor half
witted, nor anything like that&mdash;just a
plain idiot! He has graduated from the
University with high honours, and you,
with your miserable little boarding-school
education, have instructed him on many
subjects. I am thoroughly ashamed of
you."</p>

<p>When she finally slept, her dreams were
a medley of handsome strangers, mixed
with dogs, and reddish-yellow curls tied up
with blue ribbons.</p>

<p>Leaning up against the corner lamp-post,
Mr. Robert Ross indulged in a spasm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
irreverent mirth, but with a great effort
he preserved a calm exterior when he
again entered the drawing-room of his
hostess.</p>

<p>On their way home Mrs. Boyce said:
"Bob, why don't you go into business with
your uncle and become a good American
citizen? We'd love to have you with us,
and there is surely a good opening here."</p>

<p>"I'll think about it," he answered, and
he did, with the usual result, for it is proverbial
that he who hesitates is lost.</p>

<p>Mr. Boyce was quite willing to shift
a part of his responsibility to the broad
shoulders of his nephew, and an agreement
was easily reached. Emperor was quartered
in the back yard, where he fretted
for a few days and then wreaked his vengeance
on sundry grocery boys and milkmen.</p>

<p>When his master went out, the dog
usually went along except when Miss Bryant
and Rex were to be favoured with a call.
If the two dogs met, the customary disturbance
ensued. Rex included Ross in
his hatred of Emperor, and Emperor was
equally hostile toward Miss Bryant.</p>

<p>"Rex," said Katherine, one day, "you
are a very nice doggie, but I won't have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
you treat Mr. Ross with such disrespect.
The other night, when we were going out,
you had no business to growl when he
buttoned my gloves, nor to sniff in that
disgusted way at the roses he brought. If
you ever do that again, I shall let the dogcatcher
take you to the pound!"</p>

<p>The imaginary spectacle of Rex en route
to the pound nearly unnerved Katherine,
but she felt that she must be severe. Ross
punished Emperor with a chain, or with
confinement in the back yard, which the
dog hated, but where it was necessary to
keep him a part of the time, and for a
while all went well.</p>

<p>But Ross went away one evening without
explaining matters to the sensitive
being in the back yard.</p>

<p>Emperor knew well enough where he
had gone&mdash;knew he was visiting that disagreeable
girl who owned that other Irish
setter&mdash;a very impertinent dog whose
manners were so bad that he was a disgrace
to the whole setter tribe!</p>

<p>He sulked over his wrongs for an hour
or so, and then crawled out through a
friendly hole in the fence which he had for
some time past been spending his hours of
imprisonment in making.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The dining-room of the house on the
avenue was lighted by a single gas jet, and
the shades were lowered. Miss Bryant
and the chafing dish together had evolved
a rarebit which made the inner man glow
with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Do you remember that awful quarrel
we had about annexing Canada to the
United States?" asked Robert.</p>

<p>Katherine remembered distinctly.</p>

<p>He went over to her side of the table.
"What do you think about it now?"</p>

<p>It was a very ordinary question, but
Miss Bryant turned scarlet.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know," she faltered.</p>

<p>He put his arm around her. "I give
in," he said; "annexation is the most desirable
thing in the world&mdash;when shall it take
place?"</p>

<p>Katherine raised her head timidly. "Say
it, sweetheart," he whispered tenderly.</p>

<p>It happened at this moment that Emperor
arrived in search of his master. Rex
was sitting on the front steps and declined
to take in his card. Then the shrieking,
howling barking ball rolled into the vestibule,
and Ross made a dash for the door.
With considerable effort he got Rex into
the back yard, and locked Emperor into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the vestibule. Then he went back to
Katherine.</p>

<p>He tried to speak lightly, but his voice
trembled with earnestness: "Dearest,
this entire affair has been coloured, and
suggested by, and mixed up with dogs. I
think now there will be an interval of
peace for at least ten minutes, and I am
asking you to marry me."</p>

<p>Rex raised his voice in awful protest,
and Emperor replied angrily to the challenge,
as he raged back and forth in the
vestibule, but Robert heard Katherine's
tremulous "Yes" with a throb of joy
which even the consciousness of warring
elements outside could not lessen. The
little figure against his breast shook with
something very like a giggle, and Katherine's
eyes shining with merriment met his
with the question: "What on earth shall
we do with the dogs?"</p>

<p>Robert laughed and drew her closer:
"It's strictly international, isn't it? Canada
and the United States quarrel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Ireland arbitrates!" said Katherine.</p>

<p>Three months later, in the drawing-room
on Jefferson Avenue, to the accompaniment
of flowers, lights, and soft music,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the treaty was declared permanent. There
was a tiny dark coloured footprint on the
end of Katherine's train, which no one
appeared to notice, and a white silk handkerchief
carefully arranged hid from public
view a slightly larger spot on the shining
linen of the bridegroom, where Emperor
had registered his enthusiastic approval
of his master's apparel.</p>

<p>But the rest of the committee, in pale
green gowns, were bridesmaids, while Emperor
and Rex, resplendent in new collars,
and having temporarily adjusted their
difference as long as they were under
guard, had seats of honour among the
guests.</p>

<h2>A Child of Silence</h2>


<p>At the end of the street stood the little
white house which Jack Ward was
pleased to call his own. Five years he had
lived there, he and Dorothy. How happy
they had been! But things seemed to have
gone wrong some way, since&mdash;since the
baby died in the spring. A sob came into
Jack's throat, for the little face had
haunted him all day.</p>

<p>Never a sound had the baby lips uttered,
and the loudest noises had not disturbed
his rest. It had seemed almost too much
to bear, but they had loved him more, if
that were possible, because he was not as
other children were. Jack had never been
reconciled but Dorothy found a world of
consolation in the closing paragraph of a
magazine article on the subject:</p>

<p>"And yet we cannot believe these Children
of Silence to be unhappy. Mrs.
Browning says that 'closed eyes see more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
truly than ever open do,' and may there
not be another world of music for those to
whom our own is soundless? In a certain
sense they are utterly beyond the pain
that life always brings, for never can they
hear the cruel words beside which physical
hurts sink into utter insignificance. So
pity them not, but believe that He knoweth
best, and that what seems wrong and
bitter is often His truest kindness to His
children."</p>

<p>Dorothy read it over and over until she
knew it by heart. There was a certain
comfort in the thought that he need not
suffer&mdash;that he need never find what a
world of bitterness lies in that one little
word&mdash;life. And when the hard day came
she tried to be thankful, for she knew that
he was safer still&mdash;tried to see the kindness
that had taken him back into the Unknown
Silence of which he was the Child.</p>

<p>Jack went up the steps this mild winter
evening, whistling softly to himself, and
opened the door with his latch-key.</p>

<p>"Where are you, girlie?"</p>

<p>"Up stairs, dear. I'll be down in a
minute," and even as she spoke Dorothy
came into the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of her black gown and the hollows
under her eyes, she was a pretty
woman. She knew it, and Jack did too.
That is he had known, but he had forgotten.</p>

<p>"Here's the evening paper." He tossed
it into her lap as she sat down by the
window.</p>

<p>"Thank you." She wondered vaguely
why Jack did not kiss her as he used to,
and then dismissed the thought. She was
growing accustomed to that sort of thing.</p>

<p>"How nice of you to come by the early
train! I didn't expect you until later."</p>

<p>"There wasn't much going on in town,
so I left the office early. Any mail? No?
Guess I'll take Jip out for a stroll."
The fox-terrier at his feet wagged his tail
approvingly. "Want to go, Jip?"</p>

<p>Jip answered decidedly in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"All right, come on," and Dorothy
watched the two go down the street with
an undefined feeling of pain.</p>

<p>She lit the prettily shaded lamp and
tried to read the paper, but the political
news, elopements, murders, and suicides
lacked interest. She wondered what had
come between her and Jack. Something
had, there was no question about that;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
but&mdash;well, it would come straight sometime.
Perhaps she was morbid and unjust.
She couldn't ask him what was the matter
without making him angry and she had
tried so hard to make him happy.</p>

<p>Jip announced his arrival at the front
door with a series of sharp barks and an
unmistakable scratch. She opened it as
Jack sauntered slowly up the walk and
passed her with the remark:</p>

<p>"Dinner ready? I'm as hungry as a
bear."</p>

<p>Into the cozy dining-room they went,
Jip first, then Jack, then Dorothy. The
daintily served meal satisfied the inner
man, and he did not notice that she ate
but little. She honestly tried to be entertaining,
and thought she succeeded fairly
well. After dinner he retired into the
depths of the evening paper, and Dorothy
stitched away at her embroidery.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jack looked at his watch.
"Well, it's half past seven, and I've got
to go over to Mrs. Brown's and practise a
duet with her for to-morrow."</p>

<p>Dorothy trembled, but only said: "Oh,
yes, the duet. What is it this time?"</p>

<p>"'Calvary,' I guess, that seems to take
the multitude better than anything we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
sing. No, Jip, not this time. Good-bye,
I won't be gone long."</p>

<p>The door slammed, and Dorothy was
alone. She put away her embroidery and
walked the floor restlessly. Mrs. Brown
was a pretty widow, always well dressed,
and she sang divinely. Dorothy could not
sing a note though she played fairly well,
and Jack got into a habit of taking Mrs.
Brown new music and going over to sing
it with her. An obliging neighbour had
called that afternoon and remarked maliciously
that Mr. Ward and Mrs. Brown
seemed to be very good friends. Dorothy
smiled with white lips, and tried to say
pleasantly, "Yes, Mrs. Brown is very
charming, don't you think so? I am sure
that if I were a man I should fall in love
with her."</p>

<p>The neighbour rose to go and by way of a
parting shot replied: "That seems to be
Mr. Ward's idea. Lovely day, isn't it?
Come over when you can."</p>

<p>Dorothy was too stunned to reply. She
thought seriously of telling Jack, but
wisely decided not to. These suburban
towns were always gossipy. Jack would
think she did not trust him. And now he
was at Mrs. Brown's again!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The pain was almost blinding. She went
to the window and looked out. The rising
moon shone fitfully upon the white signs of
sorrow in the little churchyard far to the
left.</p>

<p>She threw a shawl over her head and
went out. In feverish haste she walked
over to the little "God's Acre" where the
Child of Silence was buried.</p>

<p>She found the spot and sat down. A
thought of Mrs. Browning's ran through
her mind:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Thank God, bless God, all ye who suffer not<br />
More grief than ye can weep for&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then someway the tears came, a blessed
rush of relief.</p>

<p>"Oh, baby dear," she sobbed, pressing
her lips to the cold turf above him, "I wish
I were down there beside you, as still and
as dreamless as you. You don't know
what it means&mdash;you never would have
known. I'd rather be a stone than a
woman with a heart. Do you think that
if I could buy death I wouldn't take it and
come down there beside you? It hurt me
to lose you, but it wasn't the worst. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
would have loved me. Oh, my Child of
Silence! Come back, come back!"</p>

<p>How long she stayed there she never
knew, but the heart pain grew easier after a
while. She pressed her lips to the turf again.
"Good night, baby dear, good night. I'll
come again. You haven't lost your mother
even if she has lost you!"</p>

<p>Fred Bennett passed by the unfrequented
spot, returning from an errand to
that part of town, and he heard the last
words. He drew back into the shadow.
The slight black figure appeared on the
sidewalk a few feet ahead of him and
puzzled him not a little. He followed
cautiously and finally decided to overtake
her. As she heard his step behind her she
looked around timidly.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ward!"</p>

<p>His tone betrayed surprise, and he saw
that her eyes were wet and her white,
drawn face was tear-stained. She shuddered.
A new trouble faced her. How
long had he been following her?</p>

<p>He saw her distress and told his lie bravely.
"I just came around the corner here."</p>

<p>Her relieved look was worth the sacrifice
of his conscientious scruples, he said to
himself afterward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"I may walk home with you, may I
not?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>She took his offered arm and tried to
chat pleasantly with her old friend. Soon
they reached the gate. She dropped his
arm and said good night unsteadily. Bennett
could bear it no longer and he took
both of her hands in his own.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ward, you are in trouble. Tell
me, perhaps I can help you." She was
silent. "Dorothy, you will let me call
you so, will you not? You know how
much I cared for you in a boy's impulsive
fashion, in the old days when we were at
school; you know that I am your friend
now&mdash;as true a friend as a man can be to a
woman. Tell me, Dorothy, and let me
help you."</p>

<p>There was a rustle of silk on the pavement
and her caller of the afternoon swept
by without speaking. Already Dorothy
knew the story which would be put in circulation
on the morrow. Bennett's clasp
tightened on her cold fingers. "Tell me,
Dorothy, and let me help you!" he said
again.</p>

<p>The impulse to tell him grew stronger,
and she controlled it with difficulty. "It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
is nothing, Mr. Bennett, I&mdash;I have a headache."</p>

<p>"I see, and you came out for a breath of
fresh air. Pardon me. I am sure you
will be better in the morning. These cool
nights are so bracing. Good night, and
God bless you&mdash;Dorothy."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bennett was on his way to
Mrs. Brown's cottage. His mind was
made up, and he would speak to Jack. He
had heard a great deal of idle gossip, and
it would probably cost him Jack's friendship,
but he would at least have the satisfaction
of knowing that he had tried to do
something for Dorothy. He rang the bell
and Mrs. Brown herself answered it.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mrs. Brown. No, thank
you, I won't come in. Just ask Jack if
I may see him a minute on a matter of
business."</p>

<p>Ward, hearing his friend's voice, was
already at the door.</p>

<p>"I'll be with you in a minute, Fred," he
said. "Good night, Mrs. Brown; I am
sure we shall get on famously with the
duet." And the two men went slowly
down the street.</p>

<p>They walked on in silence until Jack
said: "Well, Bennett, what is it? You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
don't call a fellow out like this unless it is
something serious."</p>

<p>"It is serious, Jack; it's Dor&mdash;it's Mrs.
Ward."</p>

<p>"Dorothy? I confess I am as much in
the dark as ever."</p>

<p>"It's this way, Jack, she is in trouble."</p>

<p>Ward was silent.</p>

<p>"Jack, you know I'm a friend of yours;
I have been ever since I've known you.
If you don't take what I am going to say
as I mean, you are not the man I think
you are."</p>

<p>"Go on, Fred, I understand you. I was
only thinking."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't know it, but the
town is agog with what it is pleased to
term your infatuation for Mrs. Brown."
Jack smothered a profane exclamation,
and Bennett continued. "Dorothy is eating
her heart out over the baby. She was
in the cemetery to-night sobbing over his
grave and talking to him like a mad
woman. I came up the back street, and
after a little I overtook her and walked
home with her. That's how I happen to
know. And don't think for a moment
that she hasn't heard the gossip. She has,
only she is too proud to speak of it. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Jack, old man, I don't believe you've
neglected her intentionally, but begin
again and show her how much you care
for her. Good night."</p>

<p>Bennett left him abruptly, for the old
love for Dorothy was strong to-night; not
the fitful flaming passion of boyhood, but
the deeper, tenderer love of his whole life.</p>

<p>Jack was strangely affected. Dear little
Dorothy! He had neglected her. "I
don't deserve her," he said to himself, "but
I will."</p>

<p>He passed a florist's shop, and a tender
thought struck him. He would buy Dorothy
some roses. He went in and ordered
a box of American Beauties. A stiff silk
rustled beside him and he lifted his hat
courteously.</p>

<p>"Going home, Mr. Ward? It's early,
isn't it?" "But," with scarcely perceptible
emphasis, "it's&mdash;none&mdash;too soon!"
Then as her eager eye caught a glimpse of
the roses, "Ah, but you men are sly! For
Mrs. Brown?"</p>

<p>Jack took his package and responded
icily, "No, for Mrs. Ward!" "Cat!" he
muttered under his breath as he went out.
And that little word in the mouth of a man
means a great deal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>He entered the house, and was not surprised
to find that Dorothy had retired.
She never waited for him now. He took
the roses from the box and went up-stairs.</p>

<p>"Hello, Dorothy," as the pale face rose
from the pillow in surprise. "I've brought
you some roses!" Dorothy actually
blushed. Jack hadn't brought her a rose
for three years; not since the day the baby
was born. He put them in water and
came and sat down beside her.</p>

<p>"Dear little girl, your head aches,
doesn't it?" He drew her up beside him
and put his cool fingers on the throbbing
temples. Her heart beat wildly and happy
tears filled her eyes as Jack bent down and
kissed her tenderly. "My sweetheart!
I'm so sorry for the pain."</p>

<p>It was the old lover-like tone and Dorothy
looked up.</p>

<p>"Jack," she said, "you do love me, don't
you?"</p>

<p>His arms tightened about her. "My
darling, I love you better than anything
in the world. You are the dearest little
woman I ever saw. It isn't much of a
heart, dear, but you've got it all. Crying?
Why, what is it, sweetheart?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"The baby," she answered brokenly,
and his eyes overflowed too.</p>

<p>"Dorothy, dearest, you know that was
best. He wasn't like&mdash;" Jack couldn't say
the hard words, but Dorothy understood
and drew his face down to hers again.</p>

<p>Then she closed her eyes, and Jack held
her until she slept. The dawn found his
arms around her again, and when the early
church bells awoke her from a happy
dream she found the reality sweet and
beautiful, and the heartache a thing of
the past.</p>

<h2>The Dweller in Bohemia</h2>


<p>The single lamp in "the den" shone in a
distant corner with a subdued rosy
glow; but there was no need of light other
than that which came from the pine knots
blazing in the generous fireplace.</p>

<p>On the rug, crouched before the cheerful
flame, was a woman, with her elbow on
her knee and her chin in the palm of her
hand.</p>

<p>There were puzzled little lines in her
forehead, and the corners of her mouth
drooped a little. Miss Archer was tired,
and the firelight, ever kind to those who
least need its grace, softened her face into
that of a wistful child.</p>

<p>A tap at the door intruded itself into her
reverie. "Come," she called. There was
a brief silence, then an apologetic masculine
cough.</p>

<p>Helen turned suddenly. "Oh, it's you,"
she cried. "I thought it was the janitor!"</p>

<p>"Sorry you're disappointed," returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Hilliard jovially. "Sit down on the rug
again, please,&mdash;you've no idea how comfortable
you looked,&mdash;and I'll join you
presently." He was drawing numerous
small parcels from the capacious pockets
of his coat and placing them upon a
convenient chair.</p>

<p>"If one might enquire&mdash;" began Helen.</p>

<p>"Certainly, ma'am. There's oysters
and crackers and parsley and roquefort,
and a few other things I thought we might
need. I know you've got curry-powder
and celery-salt, and if her gracious ladyship
will give me a pitcher, I'll go on a still
hunt for cream."</p>

<p>"You've come to supper, then, I take
it," said Helen.</p>

<p>"Yes'm. Once in a while, in a newspaper
office, some fellow is allowed a few
minutes off the paper. Don't know why,
I'm sure, but it has now happened to me.
I naturally thought of you, and the chafing
dish, and the curried oysters you have been
known to cook, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Helen laughed merrily. "Your heart's
in the old place, isn't it&mdash;at the end of
your esophagus?"</p>

<p>"That's what it is. My heart moves up
into my throat at the mere sight of you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
The colour flamed into her cheeks. "Now
will you be good?" he continued enquiringly.
"Kindly procure for me that pitcher
I spoke of."</p>

<p>He whistled happily as he clattered down
the uncarpeted stairs, and Helen smiled to
herself. "Bohemia has its consolations as
well as its trials," she thought. "This would
be impossible anywhere else."</p>

<p>After the last scrap of the feast had been
finished and the dishes cleared away,
Frank glanced at his watch. "I have just
an hour and a half," he said, "and I have a
great deal to say in it." He placed her in
an easy chair before the fire and settled
himself on a cushion at her feet, where he
could look up into her face.</p>

<p>"'The time has come, the walrus said, to
talk of many things,'" quoted Helen lightly.</p>

<p>"Don't be flippant, please."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," she replied, readily
adjusting herself to his mood, "what's the
trouble?"</p>

<p>"You know," he said in a different tone,
"the same old one. Have you nothing to
say to me, Helen?"</p>

<p>Her face hardened, ever so slightly, but
he saw it and it pained him. "There's no
use going over it again," she returned, "but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
if you insist, I will make my position clear
once for all."</p>

<p>"Go on," he answered grimly.</p>

<p>"I'm not a child any longer," Helen
began, "I'm a woman, and I want to make
the most of my life&mdash;to develop every
nerve and faculty to its highest and best
use. I have no illusions but I have my
ideals, and I want to keep them. I want
to write&mdash;you never can understand how
much I want to do it&mdash;and I have had a
tiny bit of success already. I want to
work out my own problems and live my
own life, and you want me to marry you
and help you live yours. It's no use,
Frank," she ended, not unkindly, "I can't
do it."</p>

<p>"See here, my little comrade," he
returned, "you must think I'm a selfish
beast. I'm not asking you to give up
your work nor your highest and best development.
Isn't there room in your life for
love and work too?"</p>

<p>"Love and I parted company long
ago," she answered.</p>

<p>"Don't you ever feel the need of it?"</p>

<p>She threw up her head proudly. "No,
my work is all-sufficient. There is no joy
like creation; no intoxication like success."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"But if you should fail?"</p>

<p>"I shall not fail," she replied confidently.
"When you dedicate your whole life to a
thing, you simply must have it. The only
reason for a failure is that the desire to
succeed is not strong enough. I ask no
favours&mdash;nothing but a fair field. I'm
willing to work, and work hard for everything
I get, as long as I have the health
and courage to work at all."</p>

<p>He looked at her a long time before he
spoke again. The firelight lingered upon
the soft curves of her throat with a caressing
tenderness. Her eyes, deep, dark,
and splendid, were shining with unwonted
resolution, and her mouth, though set in
determined lines, had a womanly sweetness
of its own. Around her face, like a halo,
gleamed the burnished glory of her hair.</p>

<p>For three long years he had loved her.
Helen, with her eyes on things higher than
love and happiness, had persistently eluded
his wooing. His earnest devotion touched
her not a little, but she felt her instinctive
sympathy for him to be womanish weakness.</p>

<p>"This is final?" he asked, rising and
standing before her.</p>

<p>She rose also. "Yes, please believe me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>&mdash;it
<i>must</i> be final; there is no other way.
I don't want lovers&mdash;I want friends."</p>

<p>"You want me, then, to change my love
to friendship?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Never to tell you again that I love
you?"</p>

<p>"No, never again."</p>

<p>"Very well, we are to be comrades,
then?"</p>

<p>She gave him her hand. "Yes, working
as best we may, each with the understanding
and approval of the other; comrades in
Bohemia."</p>

<p>Some trick of her voice, some movement
of her hand&mdash;those trifles so potent with a
man in love&mdash;beat down his contending
reason. With a catch in his breath, he
crushed her roughly to him, kissed her
passionately on the mouth, then suddenly
released her.</p>

<p>"Women like you don't know what you
do," he said harshly. "You hold a man
captive with your charm, become so
vitally necessary to him that you are nothing
less than life, enmesh, ensnare him at
every opportunity, then offer him the cold
comfort of your friendship!"</p>

<p>He was silent for a breathless instant;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
then in some measure, his self-control
came back. "Pardon me," he said gently,
bending over her hand. "I have startled
you. It shall not occur again. Good
night and good luck&mdash;my comrade in
Bohemia!"</p>

<p>Helen stood where he had left her until
the street door closed and the echo of
his footsteps died away. The fire was a
smouldering heap of ashes, and the room
seemed deathly still. Her cheeks were hot
as with a fever, and she trembled like one
afraid. It was the first time he had
crossed the conventional boundary, and he
had said it would be the last, but Love's
steel had struck flame from the flint of her
maiden soul.</p>

<p>"I wish," she said to herself as she put
the room in order, "that I lived on some
planet where life wasn't quite so serious."</p>

<p>For his part he was pacing moodily
down the street, with his hands in his
pockets. Several times he swallowed a
persistent lump in his throat. He could
understand Helen's ambition, and her
revolt against the conventions, but he
could not understand her point of view.
Even now, he would not admit that she
was wholly lost to him. What she had said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
came back to him with convincing force:
"When you dedicate your whole life to a
thing, you simply must have it."</p>

<p>"We'll see," he said to himself grimly,
"just how true her theory is."</p>

<p>Months passed, and Helen worked hard.
She was busy as many trusting souls have
been before with "The Great American
Novel." She was putting into it all of
her brief experience and all of her untried
philosophy of life. She was writing of
suffering she had never felt, and of love
she could not understand.</p>

<p>She saw Frank now and then, at studio
teas and semi-Bohemian gatherings, at
which the newspaper men were always a
welcome feature. There was no trace of
the lover in his manner, and she began to
doubt his sincerity, as is the way with
women.</p>

<p>"So this is Bohemia?" he asked one
evening when they met in a studio in the
same building as Helen's den.</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;why not?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking it must be a pretty poor
place if this is a fair sample of the inhabitants,"
he returned easily.</p>

<p>She flushed angrily. "I do not see why
you should think so. Here are authors,
musicians, poets, painters and playwrights&mdash;could
one be in better company?"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>He paid no attention to her ironical
question. "Yes," he continued, "I see
the authors. One is a woman&mdash;pardon
me, a female&mdash;who has written a vulgar
novel, and gained a little sensational
notoriety. The other is a man who paid
a fifth-rate publishing house a goodly
sum to issue what he calls 'a romance.'
The musicians are composers of 'coon
songs' even though the African Renaissance
has long since waned, and members
of theatrical orchestras. The poets have
their verses printed in periodicals which
'do not pay for poetry.' The only playwright
present has written a vaudeville
sketch&mdash;and I don't see the painters. Are
they painting billboards?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Helen, with exquisite
iciness, "since you find us all so far beneath
your level, you will have the goodness to
withdraw. Your superiority may make us
uncomfortable."</p>

<p>Half in amusement, and half in surprise,
he left her in a manner which was meant
to be coldly formal, and succeeded in being
ridiculous.</p>

<p>After a while, Helen went home, dissatisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
with herself, and for the first time
dissatisfied with the Bohemia over the
threshold of which she had stepped.
Always honest, she could not but admit
the truth of his criticism. Yet she was
wont to judge people by their aspirations
rather than by their achievements. "We
are all workers," she said to herself, as she
brushed her hair. "Every one of those
people is aspiring to what is best and highest
in art. What if they have failed? Not
fame, nor money, but art for art's dear
sake. I am proud to be one of them."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the course of a few weeks the novel
was finished, and she subjected it to careful,
painstaking revision. She studied each
chapter singly, to see if it could not be
improved, even in the smallest detail.
When the last revision had been made,
with infinite patience, she was satisfied.
She wanted Frank to read it, but was too
proud to make the first overtures towards
reconciliation.</p>

<p>The first three publishers returned the
manuscript with discouraging promptness.
Rejected short stories and verse began to
accumulate on her desk. Sunday newspaper
specials came home with "return"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
written in blue pencil across the neatly
typed page. Courteous refusal blanks
came in almost every mail, and still Helen
did not utterly despair. She had put into
her work all that was best of her life and
strength, and it was inconceivable that she
should fail.</p>

<p>Two more publishing houses returned
her novel without comment, and with a
sort of blind faith, she sent it out again.
This time, too, it came back, but with a
kindly comment by the reader. "You
cannot write until you have lived,"
was his concluding sentence. Helen sat
stiff and still with the letter crumpled in
her cold fingers.</p>

<p>Slowly the bitter truth forced itself upon
her consciousness. "I have failed," she
said aloud, "I have failed&mdash;failed&mdash;failed."
A dry tearless sob almost choked her, and
with sudden passionate hatred of herself
and her work, she threw her manuscript
into the fire. The flames seized it hungrily.
Then, someway, the tears came&mdash;a blessed
rush of relief.</p>

<p>Hilliard found her there when he came
at dusk, with a bunch of roses by way of a
peace offering. The crumpled letter on
the floor and the shrivelled leaves of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
burned paper in the fireplace afforded him
all the explanation he needed. He sat
down on the couch beside her and took her
trembling hands in his.</p>

<p>The coolness of his touch roused her,
and she sighed, burying her tear-stained
face in the roses. "I have failed," she said
miserably, "I have failed."</p>

<p>He listened without comment to the
pitiful little story of hard work and bitter
disappointments. "I've given up everything
for my art," she said, with a little
quiver of the lips, "why shouldn't I succeed
in it?"</p>

<p>The temptation to take her in his arms
temporarily unmanned him. He left her
abruptly and stood upon the hearth rug.</p>

<p>"You are trying to force the issue," he
said quietly. "You ar'n't content to be a
happy, normal woman, and let art take
care of itself. You should touch life at
first hand, and you are not living. You
are simply associating with a lot of hysterical
failures who call themselves 'Bohemians.'
Art, if it is art, will develop in
whatever circumstances it is placed. Why
shouldn't you just be happy and let the
work take care of itself? Write the little
things that come to you from day to day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and if a great utterance is reserved for you,
you cannot but speak it, when the time
comes for it to be given to the world."</p>

<p>Helen stared at him for a moment, and
then the inner tension snapped. "You
are right," she said, sadly, instinctively
drawing toward him. "I am forcing the
issue."</p>

<p>They stood looking into each other's
eyes. Helen saw the strong, self-reliant
man who seemed to have fully learned the
finest art of all&mdash;that of life. She felt that
it might be possible to love him, if she
could bring herself to yield the dazzling
vista of her career. All unknowingly, he
had been the dearest thing in the world to
her for some little time. Bohemia's glittering
gold suddenly became tinsel. There
came a great longing to "touch life at first
hand."</p>

<p>He saw only the woman he loved,
grieved, pained, and troubled; tortured by
aspirations she could not as yet attain, and
stung by a self-knowledge that came too
late. A softer glow came into Helen's face
and the lover's blind instinct impelled him
toward her with all his soul in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart," he said huskily.</p>

<p>Helen stopped him. "No," she said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
humbly, "I must say it all myself. You
are right, and I am wrong. I must live
before I am a woman and I must be a
woman before I can be an artist. I have
cared for you for a long time, but I have
been continually fighting against it&mdash;I see
it all now. I will be content to be a happy
woman and let the work take care of itself.
Faulty, erring and selfish, I see myself,
now, but will you take me just as I am?"</p>

<p>The last smouldering spark of fire had
died out and left the room in darkness.
Helen's face showing whitely in the shadow
was half pleading, and wholly sweet.</p>

<p>Speechless with happiness, he could not
move. A thousand things struggled for
utterance, but the words would not come.
She waited a moment, and then spoke again.</p>

<p>"Have I not humbled myself enough?
Is there anything more I can say? I
should not blame you if you went away,
I know I deserve it all." The old tide of
longing surged into the man's pulses again,
and broke the spell which lay upon him.
With a little cry, he caught her in his arms.
She gave her lips to his in that kiss of full
surrender which a woman gives but once
in her life, then, swinging on silent hinges,
the doors of her Bohemia closed forever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>



<h2>A Minor Chord</h2>


<p>One afternoon before Christmas, a man
with bowed head and aimless step
walked the crowded streets of a city. The
air was clear and cold, the blue sky was
dazzlingly beautiful, the sun shone brightly
upon his way, yet in his face was unspeakable
pain.</p>

<p>His thoughts were with the baby daughter
whom he had seen lowered into the
snow, only a few hours before. He saw it
all,&mdash;the folds of the pretty gown, the pink
rose in the tiny hands, and the happy
smile which the Angel of the Shadow had
been powerless to take away.</p>

<p>"You will forget," a friend had said to
him.</p>

<p>"Forget," he said to himself again and
again. "You can't forget your heart,"
he had answered, "and mine is out there
under the snow."</p>

<p>Through force of habit, he turned down
the street on which stood the great church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
where he played the organ on Sundays
and festival days. He hesitated a moment
before the massive doorway, then felt in
his pocket for the key, unlocked the door
and went in. The sun shone through the
stained glass windows and filled the old
church with glory, but his troubled eyes
saw not. He sat down before the instrument
he loved so well and touched the keys
with trembling fingers. At once, the music
came, and to the great heart of the organ
which swelled with pity and tenderness,
he told his story. Wild and stormy with
resentment at first, anger, love, passion,
and pain blended together in the outburst
which shook the very walls of the church.</p>

<p>"God gives us hearts&mdash;and breaks
them," he thought and his face grew
white with bitterness.</p>

<p>Beside himself with passion, he played
on, and on, till the sun sank behind the
trees and the afternoon shaded into twilight.</p>

<p>As the shadows filled the church, he
accidentally struck a minor chord, plaintive,
sweet, almost sad.</p>

<p>He stopped. With that sound a flood
of memories came over him&mdash;an autumn
day in the woods, the trees dropping leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of crimson and gold, the river flowing at
his feet, with the purple asters and goldenrod
on its banks, and beside him the fair
sweet girl who had made his life a happy
one;&mdash;and insensibly he drifted into the
melody, dreaming, on the saddest day of his
life, of the day which had been his happiest.</p>

<p>He remembered the look in her eyes
when he had first kissed her. Beautiful
eyes they were, brown, soft, and tender,
with that inward radiance which comes to
a woman only when she looks into the face
of the man she loves.</p>

<p>"I will go to her," he whispered, "but
not yet, not yet!" And still he played on
in that vein of sadness, the sweet influence
stealing into his heart till the pain was
hushed in peace. Conscious only of a
strange sense of uplifting, the music grew
stronger as the thought of the future was
before him. He was young, talented, he
had a wife to live for, and a child&mdash;no, not
a child&mdash;and the tears stole over his cheeks
as he again touched the minor chord.</p>

<p>The crescendo came again. The child
was safe in the white arms of the snow, and
she was hidden away from the sorrows of
the earth in the only place where we are
ever safe from these&mdash;in its heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The moon had risen over the hill-tops,
and the church was as light as if touched
on every side with silver. The organ
sounded a strain of exultation in which the
minor chord was in some way mingled
with the theme. He could face the world
now. Any one can die but it takes a hero
to live. Something he had read came back
to him: "Once to every human being, God
gives suffering&mdash;the anguish that cuts,
burns and stings. The terrible 'one day'
always comes and after it our hearts are
sometimes cruel and selfish&mdash;or sometimes
tender as He wishes them to be."</p>

<p>And the strong soul rose above its
bitterness, for his "one day" was over,
and it could never come again. His
strength asserted itself anew as he came
down from the organ loft and went toward
the door. A little bundle in one of the pews
attracted his attention, and he stooped to
see what it was. A pale, pinched baby
face looked up at him wonderingly, the
golden hair shining with celestial glory in
the moonlight. The hair, the eyes, the
position of the head were much like those
of the child he had lost.</p>

<p>Back came the rush of infinite pain&mdash;he
was not so strong as he had thought&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
only for an instant. Hark! was it an echo
or his own soul playing upon his quivering
heartstrings the minor chord? Again the
new strength reasserted itself and into his
consciousness rose the higher duty to the
living over the love and faith for the lost.</p>

<p>"Was it you played the music?" said
the sweet child voice. "I heard it and I
comed in!"</p>

<p>"Dear," he said, "where is your home?
Are you all alone?"</p>

<p>"Home," she said wonderingly.
"Home?"</p>

<p>Without another word, he took the
child in his arms and hurried out of the
doorway. Along the brilliantly lighted
avenue he hastened, till he reached the
little cottage in a side street. It was dark
within except for the fitful glancings of the
moonlight, and he deposited his burden in
a big arm-chair while he went in search of
his wife.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart," he called, "where are
you?"</p>

<p>The sweet face came into the shadow
before him, and she laid her hand upon his
arm without speaking. He led her to the
little waif saying simply: "I have brought
you a Christmas gift, dear."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>She put out her empty arms and gathered
the desolate baby to her breast. The
eternal instinct of motherhood swelled up
again and for a moment, in the touch of
the soft flesh against her own, the tiny
grave in the snow seemed only a dream.</p>

<p>"Theodora&mdash;Gift of God," he said
reverently. Then as the clouds parted,
and the moonlight filled every nook and
corner of the little room: "Dearest, we
cannot forget, but we can be brave, and
our Gift of God, shall keep us; shall it be
so?"</p>

<h2>The Madonna of the Tambourine</h2>


<p>With a discordant rumble of drums,
and the metallic clang of a dozen tambourines,
the Salvation Army procession
passed down the street. When the leader
paused at a busy corner and began to sing, a
little knot of people quickly gathered to listen.
Some quavering uncertain voices joined
in the hymn as the audience increased,
then mindful of his opportunity, a tall
young man in red and blue uniform began
an impassioned exhortation.</p>

<p>George Arnold and his friend Clayton
lingered with half humorous tolerance upon
the outskirts of the crowd. They were
about to turn away when Arnold spoke in
a low tone:</p>

<p>"Look at that girl over there."</p>

<p>The sudden flare of the torch-light
revealed the only face in the group which
could have attracted Arnold's attention.
It was that of a girl but little past twenty,
who stood by the leader holding a tambourine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
She was not beautiful in the accepted
sense of the word, but her eyes were deep
and lustrous, her mouth sensitive and
womanly, and the ugly bonnet could not
wholly conceal a wealth of raven hair.
Her skin had a delicate pearly clearness,
and upon her face was a look of exaltation
and purity as though she stood on some
distant elevation, far above the pain and
tumult of the world.</p>

<p>After a little, the Salvationists made
ready to depart, and Arnold and Clayton
turned away.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Clayton, speaking tentatively,
and gazing at the girl, "that we
have no right to criticise any belief which
puts a look like that upon a woman's face."</p>

<p>"We have no right to say a word,"
returned Arnold, "until we have the grace
to do some of the things which they do."</p>

<p>Clayton soon forgot, but the glorified,
childish face haunted Arnold. In the hope
of seeing her again, he frequented the curbstones
where the meetings were held.
Often, he wondered at the holy peace in
the eyes of so young a woman. He had
seen the same expression before, but the
face it illumined had always been battle-scarred
and weary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"She hasn't suffered yet," he said
grimly, "and that is the thing that tells."</p>

<p>Months passed and summer shaded
imperceptibly into autumn. Then, with
little sharp flurries of cold, winter took its
place. Arnold was hard at work in that
merciless slavery which is found only at
the newspaper desk.</p>

<p>"You're just a cog in the machine," he
said to Clayton one day. "Some day the
thing goes wrong, and they find out it's
your particular cog, and they get a new
one. That's all there is to it."</p>

<p>Clayton laughed at his friend's cynicism,
as he could well afford to do, for he had
just been called to a distant city to fill an
important position upon the staff of a
larger and more influential journal.</p>

<p>For some time, Arnold's particular cog
did yeoman service. He ground out more
"copy" than any man on the staff. He had
the keenest nose for news&mdash;the most delicate
way of handling a good story.</p>

<p>Sometimes as he wrote at his desk, the
face of the young Salvationist intruded
itself between him and his work. He
smiled at his foolish fancy, but dramatic
incidents began to take shape about the
image of that girl. He planned "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Great American Novel"&mdash;there is no newspaper
man who could not write it, if he
only had the time&mdash;and she was to be the
central figure.</p>

<p>All the possibilities of womanhood lay
in that sweet Madonna-like face. Thinking
along the lines of art the new century
seemed to have laid down, he struck the
key-note of his theme&mdash;the development
of the individual. His Madonna might
suffer or not, but she must grow into her
highest and best. He turned the story
over in his mind, studying it from every
standpoint. It was not yet ready for
paper and pen.</p>

<p>A year went by, and various kinds of
trouble came to Arnold. Something eventually
became wrong with the newspaper
machine, for he worked only by fits and
starts, and at last he was asked for his
resignation. His face was white and determined
when he handed it in, but he felt
that he was facing failure.</p>

<p>He had a little money laid by for an
emergency; at all events, it was enough to
supply his wants until he could write his
book. He went at it feverishly, but the
work soon began to drag. The far-off,
elusive phantom of his ideal mocked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
him behind its expression. Then he went
more slowly still, and, by almost imperceptible
degrees, he went steadily down
the pitiful ladder which leads from bad to
worse. Ambition faded, hope died, and
at last he found himself on a level with
humanity at its worst&mdash;an outcast of the
slums. Strong drink had done its work.</p>

<p>He never knew how he happened to lose
the remnant of his self-respect and get into
a quarrel with a man distinctly his inferior,
nor how he managed to slip on the icy
sidewalk and fall heavily against the curbstone.
Merciful unconsciousness blinded
him for a time, and when he came to his
senses he was in a tiny room, scantily
furnished, but exquisitely neat and clean.
He was staring at the unfamiliar surroundings
when a soft foot-fall sounded beside
the bed. He looked up&mdash;to meet the
clear eyes of the Madonna.</p>

<p>He was about to speak, but she stopped
him by a gesture. "Hush," she said, in a
voice of mellow sweetness which soothed
him inexpressibly, "you must not talk
now."</p>

<p>The touch of her cool fingers on his
throbbing temples seemed to ease the
pain. He was quite willing to obey her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and keep quiet. It was not until the day
following that he knew how badly he had
been hurt, and that it would be at least
two months before he could walk again.
"Compound fracture," the doctor said,
and Arnold shuddered, for he had heard
of such things before.</p>

<p>As the days went by, the gentle ministry
of the Madonna did not for a moment fail.
"I say," he said huskily, one morning,
"what makes you so good to me?"</p>

<p>The high color mounted to her temples.
"I want you to get well, that's all."</p>

<p>She had a library card and brought
books which he suggested. Her room was
near his and often in the night when he
was restless with pain, she came in silently,
and, holding his hot hand in her cool
fingers, read until he went to sleep. He
remembered her afterwards as she sat in
the lamplight, her hair falling around her
shoulders and over the loose black gown
which she wore about the house.</p>

<p>Her voice soothed and charmed him.
It was full of lights and, little caressing
notes and a haunting sweetness which,
someway, he could not forget. There had
been but one woman in his life, and he
knew there would be no other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>The broken bones knit slowly, but the
doctor was encouraging, and he tried hard
to be patient. He was ashamed to give
way to petulance in the presence of this
gentle, sweet-voiced woman, whose name
he knew, but whom he preferred to call
"Madonna."</p>

<p>"It means 'my lady'," he said to her one
day, "and that is what you are to me."</p>

<p>Through the whole of one painful night
she read to him from Mrs. Browning, only
resting at short intervals when from very
weariness he fell into a short and troubled
slumber.</p>

<p>Her education had been sadly neglected,
he discovered, but her eager facile mind
was quick to comprehend. She had too,
that inner sense of beauty which makes all
art its own.</p>

<p>Her voice suited itself to the exquisite
melody of the words as she read "A
Denial." When it was finished she sat
quite still, with a dreamy, far-away look in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Of what are you thinking, Madonna?"
he asked tenderly.</p>

<p>"Of this&mdash;of what it must be for a man
and woman who love each other to go
away like this&mdash;because it isn't right for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
them to be together&mdash;never to see each
other again." Then she read once more
those four lines which have in them all
the strength of loving and all the pain of
parting.</p>

<div class="poem">
"So farewell, thou whom I have met too late<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To let thee come so near;</span><br />
Be happy while men call thee great<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And one beloved woman feels thee dear&mdash;"</span><br />

<p>Something tightened around his heart
and he took her cold fingers into his own.
"There's nothing in all the world that
hurts like that, Madonna. God keep you
from knowing about it, little girl."</p>

<p>An older woman would have taken
warning from his words, but she did not.
The caressing way in which he said "little
girl" filled her soul with strange joy. She
had a childish, unquestioning faith in him.
Some day when he was better&mdash;but further
than this her maiden thought refused to
go. She simply waited, as a queen might
wait for her coronation day.</p>

<p>He was planning to repay her kindness
if it were in any way possible. He knew
she would not take money from him, but
there were other ways. Flowers&mdash;for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
knew she loved them&mdash;the books that she
liked best, and perhaps something for the
unfortunates to whom she gave herself so
unreservedly.</p>

<p>The winter was over, and April, warm
with May's promise, came in through the
open window. Even the sullen roar of the
city streets could not drown the cheering
song of two or three stray birds.</p>

<p>The week before Easter she brought
home a tall slender lily in a pot, with a
single bud showing at the top of the green
shaft. "They told me it would blossom
for Easter," she said happily, but she did
not tell him she had saved her carfare for
days in order to buy it for him.</p>

<p>He was able to sit up now, but she
would not let him go until it was quite safe
for him to walk. She seemed to cling,
hungrily, to her last days with him. "After
Easter," she said bravely, "I won't keep
you."</p>

<p>He was watching the lily with impatience
almost equal to her own, and tiny lines of
white appeared on the green sheath. One
day, it seemed as if it would blossom too
soon, and again, they feared that it would
be after Easter when the perfect flower
opened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"It had to climb up through a pretty
dark place to find the light, didn't it,
Madonna?" he asked. "I suppose that's
the way people do, and God knows I've
had my share of the dark."</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with tender pity and he
went on. "You know, Madonna, there's
a pretty theory to the effect that you must
suffer before you amount to anything. A
man can't write nor paint, and a woman
can't sing nor play before a cruel hurt. I
don't mean the kind that makes a few
tears and is followed by forgetfulness&mdash;It's
the kind that goes right down where
you live and cuts and stings and burns.
You never think of it without a shudder,
even when the place heals up, if it ever
does. If it's lost friendship, you never
have such a friend again&mdash;if it's a lost
love, you never can care again. Suffering
would make a saint of you, but I don't
want you hurt like that&mdash;dear little girl."</p>

<p>He spoke no more, but the questioning
maiden eyes sought his. It was the day
before Easter, and on the day following it
he was to leave her.</p>

<p>For almost two months, she had been
unfailingly kind to him; reading to him
night and day, caring for him as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
he were a child, and soothing him with her
unspoken sympathy. Memory brought it
all to him with peculiar distinctness, and a
new impulse came to him&mdash;an impulse to
lay bare his heart before the deep peaceful
eyes of this child.</p>

<p>"Dear little Madonna of the Tambourine,"
he began, "there's a lot of things I
want to tell you before we say good-bye.</p>

<p>"I saw your sweet face at a curbstone
meeting once, in the days when I wasn't
an outcast, and it's haunted me ever
since. I wanted to find the peace which
made you so secure and happy&mdash;to get at
your secret of life. I wanted to be more
worthy of&mdash;" He stopped and looked at
her. Her eyes were shining like stars and
with a little catch in his voice, he went on.</p>

<p>"There's a woman, Madonna, and
worthless as I am she loved me, and married
me. We were happy for a little
while, but I couldn't keep away from the
cursed drink. That's what put me into
the slums. At last her patience and her
love gave out, and she sent me away from
her. She told me to come back to her,
either with my shield, or on it, and thanks
to you, I'm going back to her to-morrow&mdash;with
my shield."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>No sound escaped her, but her hand
grew cold as ice. Turning, he looked for
those starry eyes once more and, in a
sudden flash of understanding, he read her
secret.</p>

<p>He started to his feet. "Can it be
possible that you&mdash;that you&mdash;I never
dreamed&mdash;Oh, Madonna! Forgive me&mdash;if
you can."</p>

<p>There was a long silence, then she said
trying to speak steadily, "You are not in
the least to blame. I have had no thought
of you she could not know."</p>

<p>For a moment they looked into each
other's eyes. "I am not worthy of it,
Madonna," he said huskily, "I do not
deserve the love of any good sweet
woman."</p>

<p>"Would&mdash;would you go away to-day?"
she asked almost in a whisper; then with a
brave little smile that went straight to his
heart, she added: "It's better, I think, to
be quite alone."</p>

<p>He made his simple preparations, and
she helped him as best she could with
trembling hands, but it was dark when he
was ready to go. Neither could frame the
words they were wont to speak at parting,
so they stood in silence, hand clasping hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>With only pity and understanding in
his heart, he wanted to take her into his
arms for a moment, but she moved away
from him. "No," she said brokenly, "it
must be like this. Be what she would
have you be&mdash;she and I."</p>

<p>She stood as he had left her until the
street door closed below. She watched
him on the sidewalk, walking with slow
uncertain steps, until he was lost in the
crowd. Then, stretching out in the dark,
her empty hands, she dropped on her
knees beside the window. Her shoulders
shook with sobs, but there are no tears for
such as she. She was far beyond the
blessed flow which blinds some eyes to the
reality of pain. The inner depths, bare
and quivering, are healed by no such balm
as this.</p>

<p>She voiced only the simple question
which women of all ages have asked in the
midst of a cruel hurt&mdash;"Why? Dear God,
why must it be?"</p>

<p>Some of the last lines of "A Denial"
came to her, seemingly in pitiful comment&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
"So farewell, thou whom I have met too late<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To let thee come so near;</span><br />
Be counted happy&mdash;"<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"If only she can care again," she said to
herself, "it will not be so hard for me&mdash;if
'one beloved woman feels thee dear!'"</p>

<p>The grey dawn broke at last and found
her still upon her knees.</p>

<p>With the brightening east the signs of
life began again in the street below. After
a little she stood up and looked far across
the irregular lines of roofs and chimney
tops to the glowing tapestry of the morning
spread like a promise in the dull grey of
the sky.</p>

<p>"He didn't want me hurt like this,"
she said aloud. "He told me he didn't
want me hurt like this."</p>

<p>The first rays of the sun shot into the
little room and rested with loving touch
upon her face. The old childish look was
gone, but in the eyes of the woman who
had wrought and suffered, something of
the old peace still lay. She turned back
to her bare cheerless room, ready to face
the world again, and then a little cry
escaped her. White, radiant, glorified,
her Easter lily had bloomed.</p>

<h2>A Mistress of Art</h2>


<p>"You're not going out again this evening,
are you, George?" Pretty
Mrs. Carson seemed on the point of dissolving
in tears, but her liege lord buttoned his
coat indifferently, and began the usual search
for his hat. Having found it, he hesitated
for a moment, then came and stood before
her. "See here, Kitty," he began, not
unkindly; "we might just as well understand
this thing first as last. There's no
use in your speaking to me in that tone
just because I choose to go out in the
evening. When I married you, I didn't
expect to be tied to your apron string, and
I don't intend to be. I consider myself as
free as I was before I was married, and I
am perfectly willing to accord the same
freedom to you. When you go out, I
never ask you where you've been, nor
what time you came home, and I'd be
glad to have you equally considerate of
me. Let's be sensible, Kitty. I hate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
tears and heroics. See?" He stooped to
kiss her, and then went off, whistling a jaunty
air meant to indicate extreme cheerfulness.</p>

<p>For three evenings of that week Mr.
George Carson had sought relaxation and
entertainment away from his own fireside.
This made the fourth, and the wife of only
six months' standing, had a heavy and
joyless heart.</p>

<p>Twice before she had spoken of it,&mdash;the
first time to be answered by a laugh, the
second time by very visible irritation, and
to-night by the very cool "understanding"
chronicled above.</p>

<p>Kitty had made a marriage vow which
was not in the ceremony, but which was
none the less sincerely meant. "Whatever
happens," she said to herself, "I
simply will not nag."</p>

<p>She had read the journals for women,
written and edited by men, and this
seemed to be the corner-stone of every
piece of advice; moreover, she believed in
pretty gowns, good dinners, and bright
conversation with sentiment omitted.</p>

<p>"I can't think what it is," she meditated,
during the long cheerless evening.
Mr. Carson's appetite had proved beyond
question that the dinner was good, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
pretty house gown was certainly becoming&mdash;and
then Kitty broke down and wept,
for the gown was a new one and George
had not noticed it. On such trifles does
the happiness of women depend!</p>

<p>In the journals for women, written and
edited by men, great stress was laid on the
fact that after a woman was married, she
must keep her troubles to herself. She
believed this, too, but the next day, her
old school friend, Helen Everett, happened
in, and she sobbed out her woes in the
customary place&mdash;on the shoulder of a
spinster&mdash;forgetting the deterrent effect on
the marriage license business.</p>

<p>"My dear," said that wise young person,
"men simply will go out nights. I shouldn't
care myself&mdash;it leaves a nice long evening
to read or study, or embroider, or practice,
and if Mr. Helen Everett didn't want to
stay with me, I'd be the last one to hint
that I wanted him to."</p>

<p>"You're a man-hater, Helen," said Mrs.
Carson, trying to smile, "but I'm not. I
want George to stay at home a part of the
time. Of course I'm willing for him to go
out occasionally, for of all things, I despise
a 'sissy-man', but four or five evenings a
week&mdash;is&mdash;too&mdash;much!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The dainty handkerchief came into use
again.</p>

<p>"Philosophy teaches us," said Helen,
reminiscently, "that people, especially
men, always want what they can't get."
Kitty was reminded of the scholarly tone
in which Helen had delivered her thesis at
commencement. "To quote a contemporary
essayist, 'If a mortal knows that his
mate cannot get away, he is often severe
and unreasonable.' There is also a good
old doctrine to the effect that 'like cures
like.'"</p>

<p>"Well?" said Kitty, enquiringly.</p>

<p>"I never put my fingers into anybody's
matrimonial pie," resumed Helen, "so I'll
let you think out your own schemes to keep
the charming Mr. Carson under his own
vine and fig tree, but you know I live only
three blocks away, and there are no followers
in my camp. My brother would take
you home, any time you might care to
come."</p>

<p>Kitty was silent.</p>

<p>"Think it over, dear," said Helen as she
rose to go.</p>

<p>After several minutes of hard thought,
Kitty arrived at Helen's meaning. "This
evening shall decide it," she said to herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
"If he stays at home, I shall think that he
cares just a little bit; but if he doesn't, I'll
make him care." There was a smouldering
fire in Kitty's brown eyes, that might
at any time leap into a flame.</p>

<p>The pretty house gown appeared at
dinner again, but George, seemingly, took
no notice of it. Moreover, immediately
after the meal he found his hat, and
merely saying: "Bye-bye, Kitty," began
the jaunty whistle. She heard it as it
grew fainter, and at last, only lost it in the
distant sound of a street car.</p>

<p>The emancipated husband had no particular
place to go, and his present nocturnal
pilgrimage was undertaken purely in
the interest of wifely discipline. He
dropped into his club, but found it dull;
and perhaps the thought of Kitty's sad
little face tugged remorsefully at his heartstrings,
for he went home early.</p>

<p>The lights were low in the drawing-room,
she always left them so for him. "Must
have gone to bed about nine," he mused.
He went up-stairs, expecting to hear her
say: "Is that you, dear?" But no sound
of any sort greeted him. The house was as
silent as a tomb. After a few minutes, it
became evident that she was not at home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and he sat down with a book to await her
arrival.</p>

<p>It seemed strange, someway, without
her,&mdash;perhaps because her gown hung
from the back of a chair. It was a soft
pretty thing of pinky-yellow&mdash;he mentally
decided that must be the colour&mdash;trimmed
with creamy lace and black velvet ribbon.
It was a very pretty gown&mdash;a most adorable
gown.</p>

<p>It was half-past eleven, when Kitty
came home humming the chorus of a popular
song. She started in apparent surprise
when she saw him. "Oh, it's you, is it?"
she said indifferently.</p>

<p>"Certainly it's me," he responded irritably.
"Whom did you expect to see
here?"</p>

<p>Kitty laughed pleasantly, and drew off
her gloves. Her tailor-made gown fitted
her to perfection, it was his favorite
colour, too, and her collar and cuffs were
irreproachable.</p>

<p>"Where have you been, Kitty?" he
asked in a different tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, just out," she responded with a
yawn. "Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"Humph," responded Mr. Carson.</p>

<p>The following evening, she appeared at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
dinner in the same severe gown. She was
very pleasant and chatted on topics of
current interest quite as if he were a casual
acquaintance. She watched him with evident
uneasiness afterward, and he was certain
that he detected a faint shade of relief
on her face when he commenced hunting
for his hat.</p>

<p>Before ten he came home, and as he
half suspected, Kitty was out. His irritation
grew until he was afraid to trust himself
to speak, so he pretended to be asleep,
when she came home.</p>

<p>The cloud on the matrimonial horizon
grew larger. Outwardly Kitty was kind and
considerate, and her vigilant care for his
comfort was in no way lessened. His things
were kept in order and something he particularly
liked was always on the table, but
the old confidence was gone and in its
place was something that he hesitated to
analyse.</p>

<p>She went out every night, now. More
than once she had left him with a laconic
"Bye-bye," and he had spent a miserable
evening before an unsympathetic fire. He
learned to detest the severely correct gowns
that she always wore now.</p>

<p>"I say, Kit," he said as he rose from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
table, "don't you want to go to the theatre
to-night?"</p>

<p>"Can't," she returned shortly, "much
obliged for the 'bid' though."</p>

<p>George Carson's hair rose "like quills
upon the fretful porcupine." He had a
horror of slang from feminine lips, and he
had been drawn to Kitty in the first place,
because she never used it. "Bid!" Oh,
Heavens!</p>

<p>He paid no attention to her cheerful
farewell when she left him. He poked the
fire morosely, smoked without enjoying it,
and at last cast about for something to read.
One of the Journals for women, written
and edited by men, lay on the table, and he
grasped it as the proverbial drowning man
is wont to clutch the proverbial straw.</p>

<p>He consulted the pages of the oracle
anxiously, and he learned that it was not
wise to marry a man who had served a
term in the penitentiary, that it was harmless
enough for either man or woman to
kiss a lady cousin, but that a man cousin
must be kept at a fixed and rigid distance&mdash;that
it was wrong for cousins to marry, and
that it was not only immoral, but very
dangerous to bleach or dye the hair.</p>

<p>No rule of conduct was specified for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
man whose wife went out nights, and he
wandered aimlessly into the street. The
light and cheer of the club house seemed
inopportune, like mirth at a funeral, and he
retired into a distant corner to think.
His intimates hailed him joyously, but
were met with marked coldness. One of
them, more daring than the rest, laid a
sympathetic hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, old man?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the deuce," growled George, "can't
you let a fellow alone?"</p>

<p>He was glad that he got home before
Kitty did, for he could pretend to be asleep
when she came in. He knew it would be
only a pretence, and until midnight he
listened for her latch-key in the door. It
was long after twelve, when a carriage
stopped at the door, and then he heard a
manly voice say: "Good night, Mrs. Carson."</p>

<p>"Good night, Johnnie," she returned,
"and thank you for a pleasant evening."</p>

<p>"Johnnie!" Who in creation was "Johnnie?"</p>

<p>But there was no time to wonder, for
Kitty's foot was on the stair, and in a
frame of mind not usually favourable to
repose, he simulated sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a beautiful bracelet at her
plate the following evening.</p>

<p>"Oh, how sweet!" she said, with evident
pleasure in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to put it on?" he
asked, when she laid it aside.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she answered brightly, "only
I can't wear it with this gown. Bracelets
don't go well with linen cuffs."</p>

<p>She didn't even take it from the table
after dinner, as he noted with a pang.
Almost immediately she came in with her
hat on and stood leisurely drawing on
her gloves.</p>

<p>"You're not going out again to-night,
are you Kitty?" he asked.</p>

<p>"See here, George," she returned, "we
might just as well understand this thing,
first as last. There's no use in you speaking
to me in that tone, just because I
choose to go out in the evening. When
I married you, I didn't intend to be tied
to your apron string&mdash;I suppose, I should
say, suspender, and I don't intend to be.
I consider myself as free as I was before
I was married, and I am perfectly willing
to accord the same freedom to you.
When you go out I never ask you where
you have been, or what time you came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
home, and I'd be glad to have you equally
considerate of me. See?"</p>

<p>Without other farewell, she slammed
the outer door. He was petrified with
astonishment. Were such words ever
before addressed by a tyrannical wife
to a devoted husband? In the midst
of his trouble, the door-bell rang. Friends
of his and of Kitty's had come to call.</p>

<p>"Where's Kit?" asked Mrs. Clay, after
they had chatted a moment.</p>

<p>"She's gone out a minute&mdash;yes&mdash;no&mdash;that
is&mdash;I don't know," returned George
incoherently.</p>

<p>Mr. Clay's ready tact came to the rescue
and he picked up a program which lay
on the table, half hidden by a magazine.</p>

<p>"Tannhauser," he said cheerfully, "with
Gadski as Elizabeth! So you went
Tuesday night? We wanted to go, but
there were no seats left. How early did
you get yours?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;ah&mdash;yes&mdash;Gadski as Elizabeth&mdash;that
is&mdash;rather early. Yes, she was very
fine," said George miserably. The stunning
revelation had come to him that on
Tuesday night&mdash;the evening in which he
had heard the carriage and the voices,
Kitty had been to the opera with another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
man! And it seemed to fairly paralyse
his powers of speech. After a little while
the guests politely departed, wondering
what in the world was the matter with
the Carsons.</p>

<p>"Is he crazy?" asked Mrs. Clay.</p>

<p>"Looks like it," answered her husband
concisely.</p>

<p>Carson went up-stairs and searched
the closet until he found the pinky-yellow
gown with the black velvet bows. He
sat down with the pretty fluffy thing
in his hands. A delicate odour of violets
clung to it&mdash;Kitty always had violets
around her&mdash;and the scent seemed like
a haunting memory of a happy past,
when he had a wife who wore soft womanly
things&mdash;who loved to have him kiss her,
and never went out nights.</p>

<p>With a sudden rush of tenderness he
held the little gown close, but it yielded
him no caress in return, and he flung it
bitterly aside, feeling as he did so, that
he sat among the ashes of a desolate and
forsaken home.</p>

<p>He grew white and worn in the days
that followed. He knew dimly what a
grave might mean, since he felt the hurt
of a living loss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>He wandered through the lonely rooms
evening after evening. The sight of her
dainty fluffy things made him suffer
keenly, and a tiny jewelled slipper he
found on the floor almost unmanned him.</p>

<p>He no longer went to the club, but sat
at home among Kitty's things while she
went out as usual. One evening, after
saying "good-bye" she caught her gown
on a rocker, and turned back to free
herself.</p>

<p>He was sitting before the fire, his elbow
resting on his knee, and his chin in the
palm of his hand. It was a saddened face
that Kitty saw, with all the joy and youth
gone out of it. The flickering light made
the lines of pain very distinct, and her
heart smote her at the realisation of what
she had done. Quickly she ran up-stairs
and took off her tailor-made costume.
When she came down, he was sitting as
she had left him, unhearing, unseeing
and unheeding.</p>

<p>As she came toward him, he looked up.
At the first sight of her in the pinky-yellow
gown, he rubbed his eyes as if he
had seen wrongly. She came nearer
to him, smiling, her hands outstretched,
and he sprang to his feet. "Kitty," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
cried, "are you going to stay at home
to-night?"</p>

<p>"To-night, and always, dear, if you
want me," she replied.</p>

<p>"Want you&mdash;Oh, my little wife!" he said
brokenly, and gathered her into his arms.</p>

<p>They had a long talk after that, and
Kitty explained that she had been spending
her evenings with Helen Everett, who was
writing a book, and reading it to her,
chapter by chapter as it was finished.</p>

<p>"Who is Johnnie?" demanded George
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Helen's brother. He's only a boy,
but he's a very nice one, and he takes us
to all sorts of lovely places."</p>

<p>After a moment she continued wistfully:
"Helen's awfully clever&mdash;books,
colleges, degrees, and everything."</p>

<p>"And you have only me," said George,
laughing, and drawing her closer.</p>

<p>"You're enough, if I can only keep
you," she returned mischievously.</p>

<p>His face grew very grave. "I have
been a thoughtless brute, sweetheart.
Forgive me," he said kissing her fondly.
"And know all men by these presents,
I hereby confer upon you the degree of
Mistress of Arts."</p>

<h2>A Rosary of Tears</h2>


<p>The orchestra had paused, either
through simple human pity, or, as
seemed more likely, to rest. Even a good
orchestra must have time for physical and
mental refreshment, and the guests at the
St. James would gladly have accorded
eternity to this one, had the management
been kindly disposed and permitted it.</p>

<p>A faint breath of the tropical night
stirred the foliage in the palm-room,
where there was light and laughter and
the crystalline tinkle of glasses. The
predatory lady from Memphis, clad resplendently
in white lace, and paste jewels,
moved restlessly about the room. Her
blue eyes were cat-like in their quick
intense scrutiny. They said, at the St.
James, that nothing under the roof escaped
her knowledge.</p>

<p>Designedly she passed the two who sat at
a glass-covered table in a secluded corner,
affecting not to notice them. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
rustle of her garments and the clatter of
her high heels died away, the man spoke.</p>

<p>"She must have spilled the peroxide,"
he said with a grating laugh. Her hair
was indeed more brilliant than usual.</p>

<p>The woman laughed too&mdash;a little hysterical
laugh which sounded more like a sob.
She took her watch from the silver bag
that hung at her belt, opened it, and laid
it before them.</p>

<p>"An hour more," she answered irrelevantly.
"Like Cinderella, I must go at
twelve."</p>

<p>"Are you afraid your auto will turn
into a pumpkin drawn by white rats and
your chauffeur into&mdash;let's see, who was
Cinderella's footman?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I used to know,
but it was long ago when I was a child."</p>

<p>"You're only a child now," he returned
quickly.</p>

<p>"No, I'm a woman, and I must meet
whatever comes to me as a brave woman
should." She fixed her clear eyes on his
and spoke steadily. "I mustn't be a
coward, I mustn't refuse to do anything
just because it is hard. I've got to be
true to my best self, and you've got to
help me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The war correspondent's face whitened
for an instant, then the colour surged back
in waves. "Come out on the balcony,"
he whispered, "it's insufferable in here."</p>

<p>She followed him through the French
window. Their two chairs were in their
own particular corner still, placed as they
had been every night for a week. He
arranged the rose and green velvet cushion
at her back precisely as she liked it, and
drew his own chair near hers&mdash;just close
enough not to touch.</p>

<p>A white-coated waiter whisked out of
sight tactfully. He was needed within
where the lady from Memphis had cornered
a hardware drummer from Pittsburg
and was coyly inquiring whether or not
champagne was intoxicating.</p>

<p>"A week ago to-night," said the war
correspondent abruptly. "I believe now
that the world was made in seven days.
Mine has been made and shattered into
atoms in an equal space of time."</p>

<p>"Don't say that! There's good in it&mdash;there's
got to be good in it somewhere!
We'll have to find it together, past all
the pain."</p>

<p>The late moon rose slowly above the
grove of palms beyond them; the Southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
night breathed orange blossoms and roses.
A tiny ray of blue light shot from the
solitaire on the third finger of her left
hand. It was the only ring she wore.</p>

<p>"I can't believe it's true," he said,
somewhat roughly. "If you cared as
you say you do, you'd"&mdash;he choked on
the word, and stopped abruptly, but his
eyes made his meaning clear.</p>

<p>They were unusual eyes&mdash;for a man.
So she had thought a week ago, when she
went down the corridor to her room at
midnight, humming gaily to herself a
little fragment of a love song. They were
big and brown and boyish, with laughter
lurking in their depths&mdash;they met her
own clearly and honestly, always, and
in their look there had never been that
which makes a woman ashamed. Yes,
they were unusual eyes&mdash;for a man.</p>

<p>"Honour is an elastic word," she replied.
"For most women, it means only one
thing. A woman may lie and steal and
nag and break up homes, and steam open
other people's letters, and betray her
friends, and yet, if she is chaste, she is
called honourable. I made up my mind
early in life, that I'd make my own personal
honour include not only that, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
things men are judged by, too. If a man
broke his solemn pledge, you'd call him
a coward and a cur. So," she concluded
with a pitiful pride, "I'll not break mine."</p>

<p>Her voice was uneven and he felt,
rather than saw, the suffering plainly
written on her face. "Tell me," he began
gently, "of him. What does he look like?
What sort of man is he?"</p>

<p>"I came away in such a rush that I
forgot his picture, else I'd show it to you.
I would have sent back for it, only I didn't
want my people to think I was silly, and
besides, there is no need, I could remember
how he looked, and every tone of his voice
until a week ago to-night."</p>

<p>"Is he tall?" The war correspondent
himself was a trifle over six feet.</p>

<p>"No, not very,&mdash;only a little taller than
I."</p>

<p>"Smooth-shaven?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Dark?"</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>"What does he do?"</p>

<p>"Business in a stuffy office, from nine
to six. He spends his evenings with me."</p>

<p>"Every evening?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and all day Sunday. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
just two things in his life&mdash;the office and
me."</p>

<p>"Go on," he reminded her, after a pause.</p>

<p>"It's simple, and, in a way, commonplace.
We met, and he cared&mdash;terribly&mdash;from
the first. I didn't, because it was
difficult for me to trust any man. I told
him so, and he said he'd make me trust
him. He did, but it took him a long time.
It's pathetically easy for a woman to love
a man she can trust. And so I wear his
ring and have for two years. When I go
back, we're to be married."</p>

<p>"Do you call it honourable to marry one
man while you love another?"</p>

<p>"He's been everything in the world to
me," she continued, ignoring the thrust.
"I've never had a doubt nor a difficulty
of any kind, since I've known him, that he
hasn't helped me through. Every thought
that came into my mind, I have felt
perfectly free to tell him. We've never
quarrelled. On my side, the feeling has
been of long slow growth, but there are
no hard words lying between us. It's all
been sweet until now. He's clean-minded
and clean-hearted and true-souled. If
he has ever lied to me, I've never found it
out. He has been absolutely and unswervingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
loyal in thought, word, and
deed, and as for jealousy&mdash;why, I don't
believe he knows what the word means.</p>

<p>"You know there are two kinds of
love. One is an infinite peace that illumines
all your life, so surely and so certainly
that it's not to be taken away. It's like
daily bread to you. The other is like
wine&mdash;swift and terrible and full of fatal
fascination. The one has come to me
from him&mdash;the other from you."</p>

<p>"Honey!" It was the shrill, high, bird-like
voice of the lady from Memphis
swiftly rounding the corner of the balcony.
"Is this your watch? I've found it on
the table and I've been looking all over
for you!"</p>

<p>"Thank you." Miss Ward took the
trinket coldly and never turned her head.
The man, having small respect for the
lady from Memphis, never rose from his
chair.</p>

<p>After a little hesitation she retreated,
pausing in the background, among the
palms, to shake a warning finger with
assumed coquetry.</p>

<p>"Naughty," she shrilled. "You mustn't
flirt! If you do, I'll write to your honey
and tell him what you are doing. You see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
if I don't. And then he'll come and catch
you at it, and where will you be then?"
With a mirthless cackle, she vanished into
the palm-room, where there was light and
the tinkle of glasses and the bubbling of
champagne.</p>

<p>"Half-past eleven," said Miss Ward
dully. "Thirty minutes more."</p>

<p>The war correspondent caught his
breath as if he had been suddenly hurt.
"One little hour," he answered, his voice
low and tense with suppressed feeling.
"Only one little hour to last us for all
eternity, and we're wasting it like this.
I love you, I love you, I love you! I love
you with all my heart, with all my soul,
with all my strength, and with all my will.
I love you so much that heaven would be
hell without you, and hell itself would be
heaven if you were there. I love you with
a love that will not die, when I do. I love
you, do you understand? God knows
I love you!"</p>

<p>She turned her face towards him thrilled
to the depths of her soul. "And I," she
breathed, caught in the whirlwind of his
emotion, "love you&mdash;in just that way!"</p>

<p>His hands closed quickly over hers.
"Then," he pleaded, "come. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
no barriers between us&mdash;they are nothing
but cobwebs. Sweep them aside with one
stroke of magnificent daring and come.
We'll be married in the morning and sail
for New York immediately, then go abroad
for a year. Two telegrams will set you
free, and explain everything! Come,"
he whispered, "only come! Youth and
love, and the wide world before us! We'll
be together till death divides us! Come&mdash;promise
me you'll come!"</p>

<p>In thought she surrendered for an instant,
then broke away from him, shuddering.
"Don't," she gasped. "Don't
make it so hard for me to do what is right.
I won't be dishonourable, I won't be disloyal,
I won't be untrue. Happiness that
comes from wrong doing is always brief,
but, oh, dear lad, I love you with a love
nobody ever had before, or ever will have
again. I'm not taking anything away from
anybody else to give to you, so it isn't
dishonourable&mdash;it can't be. Tell me it
isn't!" she cried. "Oh, tell me."</p>

<p>"It isn't," he assured her. "You
couldn't be dishonourable if you tried.
You're the bravest, finest woman I've
ever known."</p>

<p>From within came the notes of a violin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
muted. The piano, mercifully softened,
followed the melody with the full rich
accompaniment which even miserable
playing can never wholly spoil.</p>

<div class="poem">
"The hours I spent with thee, dear heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are as a string of pearls to me;</span><br />
I count them o'er, every one apart&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My rosary! My rosary!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"The pearls mean tears," she whispered
brokenly. "Our rosary is made of
tears!"</p>

<p>The lady from Memphis clattered past
them on the balcony, singing the words
apparently to herself, but really with an
eye to dramatic&mdash;and impertinent&mdash;effect.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For a week they had been together,
the gayest of the gay crowd. That day
all plans had mysteriously fallen through.
Miss Ward's chaperon had been called
home by a telegram. A letter had caused
another unexpected departure, a forgotten
engagement loomed up before another,
a sick headache laid low a fourth, and
only they two were left&mdash;the "tattered
remnant of the old guard," she laughingly
said that morning when they met in the
palm-room after breakfast, as usual, to
discuss the program of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then," he retorted, "the old guard
will make the best of it!"</p>

<p>So they had spent the day together in
public places, mindful of the proprieties.
A long talk in the afternoon, full of intimate
and searching details, had paved the
way for the dazzling revelation made
by an accidental touching of hands. In
an instant, the world was changed.</p>

<p>"Suppose," she said, "that you had
been obliged to go away this afternoon,
before everything was fully acknowledged
between us? Oh, don't you see what we
have? We've got one whole day&mdash;a little
laughter, and a great deal of love and pain,
crystallised by parting and denial, into
something sweet to keep in our hearts for
always. Nothing can take to-day away
from us&mdash;it's ours beyond the reach of
estrangement or change. To-night we'll
shut the door upon it and steal away,
as from a casket enshrining the dead."</p>

<p>"Not dead," he flashed bitterly, "but
buried alive!"</p>

<div class="poem">
"Oh, memories that bless and burn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, barren gain and bitter loss,</span><br />
I kiss each bead and strive at last to learn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To kiss the cross, sweetheart! To kiss the cross."</span><br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>The last echo died away, the violin
rattled into its case, the piano was closed.
The musicians went home, and there was
a general movement toward the doors.
A far clock chimed twelve and she rose
wearily from her chair. "Good night,"
she faltered, her hand fluttering toward
his; "I cannot say good-bye, but we must
never see each other again."</p>

<p>How it happened they never knew,
but he took her into his arms, unresisting,
and kissed her fully, passionately, upon
the lips.</p>

<p>All the joy and pain of the world seemed
crowded into the instant they stood there,
locked in each other's arms. Then the
high, bird-like voice of the lady from
Memphis broke on their ears in a grating
staccato.</p>

<p>"She was out here, when I saw her last,
flirting dreadfully with the war correspondent.
I guess she didn't know you
were coming on that late train."</p>

<p>Eagerly, happily, the Other Man rushed
out on the balcony, crying boyishly,
"Mabel! Are you here?"</p>

<p>The words died on his lips. The man
who held her in his arms kissed her again,
slowly, hungrily; then reluctantly released<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
her. She steadied herself against the
railing of the balcony. In the moonlight
her face was ghastly. The scent of the
orange blossoms seemed overpowering her
with deadly fragrance.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you?" asked the lady
from Memphis gleefully. From the open
window she was enjoying the situation to
the full.</p>

<p>The Other Man was bewildered.</p>

<p>"Mabel," he said enquiringly, "I don't
quite understand. Didn't you get my
wire?"</p>

<p>The war correspondent stepped forward.
He had faced the guns of the
enemy before and was not afraid now.
A single commanding glance, mingled with
scorn, sent the lady from Memphis scurrying
back into the palm-room.</p>

<p>"I know who you are," he said to the
Other Man, "and I owe you an explanation.
I love Miss Ward and I have been
trying all day to induce her to break her
engagement with you and marry me
instead."</p>

<p>The Other Man laughed. He went to
the balcony rail, where the girl stood,
half fainting, and put his arm around her.
"I don't doubt it," he said. "Isn't she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the finest, sweetest, truest woman the
Lord ever made? Any man who doesn't
love her is a chump. You and I will be
good friends&mdash;we have a great deal in
common."</p>

<p>He offered his hand but the war correspondent
bowed and swerved aside.
"Good night," he said thickly. "I have
played and lost. I lay down my hand."
He went through the window hastily,
leaving the two alone.</p>

<p>"Mabel, dear Mabel!" said the Other
Man softly. "You've been through something
that is almost too much for you.
Sit down and rest&mdash;you're tired!"</p>

<p>The words, calm and tender, brought
back to her tortured soul a hint of the
old peace. In a pitiless flash of insight
she saw before her two women, either of
which she might become. One was serene
and content, deeply and faithfully loved,
sheltered from everything love could shield
her from, watched, taken care of in all the
countless little ways that mean so much.
The other was to know Life to its uttermost,
all its rage, jealousy and despair, to be
shaken in body and soul by fierce elemental
passions, to face eclipsing miseries alone,
and drain the cup to the lees. The difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
was precisely that between a pleasure
craft, anchored in a sunny harbour, and
the toiling ship that breasts the tempestuous
seas.</p>

<p>She sat down and suffered him to take
her hand. He stroked her wrist silently,
in the old comforting way he had when
she was nervous or tired. His face was
troubled&mdash;hers was working piteously.
The lights had died down in the palm-room
and the last of the revellers went
away. The house detective paced through
the long rooms twice and made a careful
survey of the balcony.</p>

<p>"Darling," said the Other Man, "you
don't have to tell me anything you don't
want to&mdash;you know that; but wouldn't
it make you feel better? You've always
told me things, and I'm the best friend
you've got. Surely you're not afraid
now?"</p>

<p>His voice failed at the end, and the girl
drew a quick shuddering breath but she
did not answer.</p>

<p>"He was kissing you, wasn't he?"
asked the Other Man, "when I came?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said dully, "he was kissing
me, but it was for good-bye. He told me
he loved me, and I had told him I loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
him. I've known him only a week. He
never so much as touched my hand until
to-day, but it was only my own personal
honour that kept me from marrying him
to-morrow, as he begged me to do. I've
told you the worst now. Believe what
you like&mdash;do what you will."</p>

<p>The Other Man sighed. His mouth was
boyish and for the moment unsteady,
but his eyes sought hers as honestly and
clearly as the war correspondent's, who
had unusual eyes&mdash;for a man.</p>

<p>"I think I understand," he said brokenly.
"I don't blame any man for loving
you, dear&mdash;I'm prepared for that&mdash;and
we've been separated so long, and the
moonlight and the palms and the roses
and all, and you were used to being loved&mdash;I
think that's why. You were lonesome,
wer'n't you, sweetheart? Didn't
you want me?"</p>

<p>Infinite love and infinite pain surged
together in her heart, blending into unspeakable
tenderness. "Yes, I wanted
you," she whispered&mdash;"I always want
you. I'm&mdash;I'm a bit upset just now, but
I haven't taken anything away from you
to give to anybody else. It's only an
undiscovered country&mdash;a big one, that
he found to-day. I haven't been intentionally
dishonourable. I fought but it
was no use&mdash;he simply swept me off my
feet. Forgive me if you can!"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hush! There'll never be any need
of that word between you and me. I've
forgiven you long ago, for everything
you've ever done or ever can do. It's
an unlimited fund to draw upon&mdash;that
and my love. You know," he went on
in another tone, "that if it were for your
happiness, I could give you up, but I'm
pretty sure it isn't. You'd never be as
happy with anybody you'd only known
a week, as you would with me, because
I've loved you for years. You have my
whole heart, Mabel,&mdash;there's never been
another woman with even a hint of a claim.
I know all your little moods and tenses
and you don't have to explain things to
me. I know you can't ride backward
and you don't like to walk when you have
high-heeled shoes on, and a thousand
other things that are infinitely dear just
because they are you. I was thinking
of them all the way down here, and loving
them&mdash;every one."</p>

<p>"I don't deserve it," she answered,
and then broke into a wild sobbing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>The Other Man moved his chair closer
and drew her head to his shoulder.
"There," he said, slipping a handkerchief
into the hand that covered her eyes;
"cry if you want to. You're tired&mdash;my
little girl is tired."</p>

<p>He held her so until the storm had spent
itself. He kept his face against her hair,
soft and silky, and fragrant with orris&mdash;forgetting
himself utterly in his loving
pity for her. At last she moved away from
him. Her tear-stained face in the moonlight,
filled him with tenderness so great
that his love was pain.</p>

<p>"It's late," she said, "it must be after
one o'clock. I must go up-stairs." She
started toward the open window, but still
he held her back gently. "Dear," he
said softly, "we've been away from each
other four weeks and three days, and
I've come two thousand miles to see you.
You haven't kissed me yet. Don't you
want to? You don't need to if you'd
rather not, but if you could&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice vibrated with passionate
appeal. She lifted her white face to his
and kissed him mechanically. "To-morrow,"
she breathed, "I'll be more like
myself; I'll try to make up for to-night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
but if you love me, let me go
now!"</p>

<p>He went with her to the elevator, and
watched until she was lifted out of his
sight, smiling at her until the last&mdash;the
old loving smile. He went out to the
balcony again, and sat down with his arms
thrown over the back of the chair that had
so recently held her. His brow was
wrinkled with deep thought, but his
boyish mouth still smiled.</p>

<p>Presently there was a step behind him
and he turned&mdash;to look into the face of
the war correspondent who spoke first.</p>

<p>"I've come back," he said, "to shake
hands with you, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>The Other Man's hand met his, more
than half-way.</p>

<p>"And," continued the war correspondent,
"I want to apologise. I've been all
kinds of a brute, but what I said was the
truth. I love her as no man ever before
loved a woman. That's my only excuse."</p>

<p>"You're not to blame for loving her,"
returned the Other Man generously;
"nobody is. And as for her loving you,
that's all right too. She's got a lot of
temperament and she's used to being
loved, and you're not a bad sort, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
know&mdash;not at all." And he concluded
fondly, "my little girl was lonesome
without me."</p>

<p>The war correspondent went away
quietly. In the moonlight he could see
the boyish face of the Other Man,
radiant with an all-believing, all-forgiving
love.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Other Man again,
after an interval, and not realising that
he was alone, "that was it. My little
girl was lonesome without me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<h2>The Roses and the Song</h2>


<p>There had been a lover's quarrel and
she had given him back his ring. He
thrust it into his pocket and said, unconcernedly,
that there were other girls who
would be glad to wear it.</p>

<p>Her face flushed, whether in anger or
pain he did not know, but she made no
reply. And he left her exulting in the
thought that the old love was dead.</p>

<p>As the days went by, he began to miss
her. First, when his chum died in a far-off
country, with no friend near. He
remembered with a pang how sweetly
comforting she had always been, never
asking questions, but soothing his irritation
and trouble with her gentle womanly
sympathy.</p>

<p>He knew just what she would do if he
could tell her that Tom was dead. She
would put her soft cheek against his own
rough one, and say: "I am so sorry dear.
I'm not much, I know, but you've got me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and nothing, not even death can change
that."</p>

<p>"Not even death"&mdash;yes, it was quite
true. Death changes nothing.&mdash;It is only
life that separates utterly.</p>

<p>He began to miss the afternoon walks,
the lingering in book store and art galleries,
and the quiet evenings at home over the
blazing fire, when he sat with his arm
around her and told her how he had spent
the time since they last met. Every
thought was in some way of her, and the
emptiness of his heart without her seemed
strange in connection with the fact that
the old love was dead.</p>

<p>He saw by a morning paper that there
was to be a concert for the benefit of some
charitable institution, and on the program,
printed beneath the announcement, was
her name. He smiled grimly. How
often he had gone with her when she sang
in public! He remembered every little
detail of every evening. He always waited
behind the scenes, because she said she
could sing better when he was near her.
And whatever the critics might say, she
was sure of his praise.</p>

<p>It was on the way home from one of
these affairs that he had first told her that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
he loved her. Through the rose-leaf
rain that fell from her hair and bosom at
his touch he had kissed her for the first
time, and the thrill of her sweet lips was
with him still. How short the ride had
been that night and why was the coachman
in such an unreasonable hurry to get home?</p>

<p>He made up his mind that he would not
go to the concert that night, but somehow,
he bought a ticket and was there before
the doors opened. So he went out to walk
around a little. People who went to concerts
early were his especial detestation.</p>

<p>In a florist's window he saw some
unusually beautiful roses. He had always
sent her roses before, to match her gown,
and it seemed queer not to buy them for
her now.</p>

<p>Perhaps he really ought to send her some
to show her that he cherished no resentment.
Anyone could send her flowers
over the footlights. The other men that
she knew would undoubtedly remember
her, and he didn't want to seem unfriendly.</p>

<p>So he went in. "Four dozen La France
roses," he said, and the clerk speedily
made the selection. He took a card out
of his pocket, and chewed the end of his
pencil meditatively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>It was strange that he should have
selected that particular kind, he thought.
That other night, after he had gone home,
he had found a solitary pink petal clinging
to his scarf-pin. He remembered with a
flush of tenderness that it had come from
one of the roses&mdash;his roses&mdash;on her breast.
He had kissed it passionately and hidden it
in a book&mdash;a little book which she had
given him.</p>

<p>With memory came heartache, his
empty life and her wounded love. The
words shaped themselves under his pencil:</p>

<p>"You know what the roses mean. Will
you wear one when you sing the second
time? Forgive me and love me again&mdash;my
sweetheart."</p>

<p>He tied the card himself into the centre
of the bunch, so it was half hidden by the
flowers. He gave them to the usher with
a queer tremolo note in his voice. "After
her first number, understand?"</p>

<p>There was a piano solo, and then she
appeared. What she sang he did not
know, but her deep contralto, holding
heaven in its tones, he both knew and
understood. She did not sing as well as
usual. Her voice lacked warmth and
sincerity and her intonation was faulty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
The applause was loud but not spontaneous
although many of her friends were there.
His were the only flowers she received.</p>

<p>When she came out the second time,
he looked at her anxiously, but there was
never a sign of a rose. He sank down in
his chair with a sigh and covered his face
with his hand.</p>

<p>This time she sang as only <i>she</i> could
sing. Oh, that glorious contralto! Suggestions
of twilight and dawn, of suffering
and joy, of love and its renunciation.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking her success and
the great house rang with plaudits from
basement to roof. He, only, was silent;
praying in mute agony for a sign.</p>

<p>She willingly responded to the encore
and a hush fell upon the audience with the
first notes of Tosti's "Good-Bye."</p>

<div class="poem">
"<i>Falling leaf, and fading tree.</i>"<br />
</div>

<p>Oh, why should she sing that? He
writhed as if in bodily pain, but the
beautiful voice went on and on.</p>

<div class="poem">
"<i>Good-bye, summer, good-bye, good-bye!</i>"<br />
</div>

<p>How cruel she seemed! Stately, imperious,
yet womanly, she held her listeners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
spellbound, but every word cut into his
heart like a knife.</p>

<div class="poem">
"<i>All the to-morrows shall be as to-day.</i>"<br />
</div>

<p>The tears came and his lips grew white.
Then some way into the cruel magnificence
of her voice came a hint of pity as she sang:</p>

<div class="poem">
"<i>Good-bye to hope, good-bye, good-bye!</i>"<br />
</div>

<p>There was a hush, then she began again:</p>

<div class="poem">
"<i>What are we waiting for, Oh, my heart?<br />
Kiss me straight on the brows, and part!</i>"<br />
</div>

<p>All the love in her soul surged into her
song; the joy of happy love; the agony
of despairing love; the pleading cry of
doubting love; the dull suffering of hopeless
love; and then her whole strength was
merged into a passionate prayer for the
lost love, as she sang the last words:</p>

<div class="poem">
"<i>Good-bye forever, good-bye forever!<br />
Good-bye, good-bye, good&mdash;bye&mdash;!</i>"<br />
</div>

<p>She bowed her acknowledgments again
and again, and when the clamour was over,
he hastened into the little room behind
the stage where she was putting on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
wraps. She was alone but her carriage
was waiting.</p>

<p>As he entered, she started in surprise,
then held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Dear," he said, "if this is the end,
won't you let me kiss you <i>once</i> for the sake
of our old happiness? We were so much
to each other&mdash;you and I. Even if you
wouldn't wear the rose, won't you let
me hold you just a minute as I used to do?"</p>

<p>"Wear the rose," she repeated, "what
do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you see my card?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, "I couldn't look
at them&mdash;they are&mdash;La&mdash;France&mdash;you
know&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She reached out trembling fingers and
found the card. She read the tender
message twice&mdash;the little message which
meant so much, then looked up into his
face.</p>

<p>"If I could," she whispered, "I'd pin
them all on."</p>

<p>Someway she slipped into her rightful
place again, and very little was said as
they rolled home. But when he lit the
gas in his own room he saw something
queer in the mirror, and found, clinging to
his scarf-pin, the petal of a La France rose.</p>

<h2>A Laggard in Love</h2>


<p>"My dear," said Edith judiciously,
"I think you're doing wrong."</p>

<p>Marian dabbed her eyes with a very wet
handkerchief and said nothing. Edith
adjusted the folds of her morning gown
and assumed a more comfortable position
on the couch.</p>

<p>"They all have to be managed," she
went on, "and you'll find that Mr. Thomas
Drayton is no exception. I'll venture
that when he makes his visits, which are
like those of angels, 'few and far between'
you tell him how lonesome you've been
without him, and how you've thought of
him every minute since the last time, and
perhaps even cry a little bit! Am I right?"</p>

<p>Marian nodded. "If it wasn't for that
hateful Perkins girl, I wouldn't care so
much. She's neither bright nor pretty,
and I'm sure I don't see what Tom sees
in her. I think it's more her fault than
his."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Perkins girl is entirely blameless,
Miss Reynolds, though she certainly is
unpleasant. It is Tom's fault."</p>

<p>The afflicted Miss Reynolds wiped her
eyes again. "Perhaps it's mine. If I
were quite what I ought to be, Tom
wouldn't seek other society, I'm sure."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bently sat up straight. "Marian
Reynolds," she demanded, "have you ever
said anything like that to Tom?"</p>

<p>"Something like that," Marian admitted.
"What should I have done?"</p>

<p>"Thrown a book at him," responded
Mrs. Bently energetically. Then she
leaned back among the pillows, and
twisted the corners of her handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Don't be horrid, Edith, but tell me
what to do," pleaded Marian.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bently looked straight out of the
window. "I've been married nearly ten
years," she said meditatively, "and I point
with pardonable pride to my husband.
There hasn't been any of the 'other woman
business' since the first days of our engagement.
He never forgets the little
words of endearment, he brings me flowers,
and books, and he's quite as polite to me
as he is to other women."</p>

<p>"I know," replied Marian. "I've seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
him break away from a crowd in the middle
of a sentence to put your rubbers on for
you."</p>

<p>"All that," resumed Edith, "is the
result of careful training. And what Tom
needs is heroic treatment. If you will
promise to do exactly as I say, you will
have his entire devotion inside of a month."</p>

<p>"I promise," responded Marian hopefully.</p>

<p>"First, then, take off your engagement
ring."</p>

<p>Marian's pretty brown head drooped
lower and lower, and a brighter diamond
fell into her lap. She felt again the passionate
tenderness in his voice when he
told her how much he loved her, and she
remembered how he had kissed each
finger-tip separately, then the diamond,
just because it was hers.</p>

<p>She looked at her friend with eyes full
of tears. "Edith, I can't."</p>

<p>"Take it off."</p>

<p>Marian obeyed, very slowly, then threw
herself at the side of the couch sobbing.
"Edith, Edith," she cried, "don't be so
cross to me! I am so dreadfully unhappy!"</p>

<p>"Marian, dearest, I'm not cross, but
I want you to be a sensible girl. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
happiness of your whole life is at stake,
and I want you to be brave&mdash;it is now or
never with Mr. Thomas Drayton. If
you let him torture you now for his own
amusement, he will do it all his life!"</p>

<p>"I'll try, Edith, but you don't know
how it hurts."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do know, dear; I've been
through it myself. Now listen. First, no
more tears or reproaches. Secondly, don't
allude to his absence, nor to the Perkins
girl. Thirdly, you must find some one
else at once."</p>

<p>"That's as bad as what he is doing, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"<i>Similia similibus curantur</i>," laughed
Edith. "Joe's friend, Jackson, is coming
to the city for a month or so, and he'll do
nicely. He's awfully handsome, and a
perfectly outrageous flirt. He always
singles out one girl, however, and devotes
himself to her, so we won't have any
trouble on that score. People who don't
know Jackson, think that he's in deadly
earnest, but I don't believe he ever had a
serious thought in his life."</p>

<p>"I think I have seen him," said Marian.
"Wasn't he at the Charity Ball with you
and Mr. Bently last year?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, he was there, but only for a few
minutes. Now, let's see&mdash;to-day is Thursday.
Have you seen Tom this week?"</p>

<p>Marian hesitated. "N-no, that is, not
since Sunday. But I think he will come
this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Very well, my dear, you have an
engagement for the rest of the day with
me. Run home and put on your prettiest
gown. We'll go to the Art Gallery and
call on Mrs. Kean later. We both owe
her a call, and I'll look for you at two."</p>

<p>Promptly at two o'clock Marian appeared
with all traces of tears smoothed
away. "You'll do," said Edith. "I
believe you're a thoroughbred after all."</p>

<p>At the Art Gallery they met what Mrs.
Bently termed "the insufferable Perkins"
clad in four different colours and looking
for all the world like a poster. She was
extremely pleasant, and insisted upon
showing them a picture which was "one
of Mr. Drayton's favourites."</p>

<p>Miss Reynolds adjusted her lorgnette
critically. "Yes, I think this is about
the only picture in this exhibit which Tom
and I both like. I'm so glad that you
approve of our taste, Miss Perkins,"
and Marian smiled sweetly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Edith squeezed her arm rapturously
as they moved away. "I'm proud of you.
Those pictures were hung only day before
yesterday. Why, there's Joe."</p>

<p>Mr. Bently greeted them cordially.
"Jackson came this morning, Edith, and
I have asked him to dine with us Monday
evening."</p>

<p>"That will be charming. Marian is
coming to visit us over Sunday and I think
they will like each other."</p>

<p>"I hope so," was Mr. Bently's rejoinder.
"It's really good of you to come, Miss
Reynolds, for I very seldom see you, and
Jackson is a capital fellow."</p>

<p>"Come, Marian," said Edith, "you
know we were going to make a call."</p>

<p>"Always going somewhere, aren't you,
sweetheart?" and Mr. Bently smiled
lovingly at his pretty wife.</p>

<p>"Never far away from you, dear," she
answered and waved her hand to him as
the crowd swept them apart.</p>

<p>"You're going to stay all night with me,
you know," Edith said. "We'll stop at
your house on our way back, and leave
word with your mother&mdash;incidentally we
can learn if any one has called."</p>

<p>It was almost dark when they reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Marian's home, and Edith waited in the
hall, while she went in search of her mother.
As she came down-stairs, Mrs. Bently
held up a small white card, triumphantly.
Marian's face flushed as she saw the name.</p>

<div class="center">
"<i>Mr. Thomas E. Drayton.</i>"<br />
</div>

<p>"It's all right," said her friend, "just
wait and see."</p>

<p>Friday morning, the servant who admitted
Marian, said that Mr. Drayton
had called the previous evening and left
some flowers which Miss Reynolds would
find in the library.</p>

<p>A great bunch of American Beauties
stood on the table, and almost overpowered
her with their fragrance.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear Tom! He <i>does</i> love me,"
she thought. "I'll write him a note."</p>

<p>She sat down to her desk without removing
her hat. "Perhaps I've been
mistaken all along." The words shaped
themselves under her pen: "My Dearest."
Then she stopped and surveyed it critically.
"Not in the present incarnation of Miss
Reynolds." She tore the sheet straight
across, and dropped it into the waste
basket. Taking another, she wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">My dear Tom:</span><br />
</p>

<p>"The roses are beautiful. I am passionately
fond of flowers&mdash;of roses especially,
and I must thank you for the really
great pleasure the 'Beauties' are giving
me.</p>

<div class="right">
"Sincerely yours,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Marian Reynolds</span>."<br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Over his coffee the next morning Tom
studied the little note. "I wonder what's
the matter. 'My Dear Tom'! 'Marian
Reynolds' and not a bit of love in it. It
isn't the least bit like her. I must go and
see her this afternoon. No, I'll be hanged
if I will, she had no business to be out,"
and he chewed a toothpick savagely.
"I'll ask her to go to the theatre."</p>

<p>After much cogitation, he evolved a
note which struck him as being a marvel
of diplomacy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">My dear Marian</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>"I am glad the roses give you pleasure.
Will you go to the theatre with me on
Monday evening?</p>

<div class="right">
"Yours in haste,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Tom</span>."<br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Marian's reply was equally concise:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">My dear Tom</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>"I am very sorry that I have an engagement
for Monday evening and cannot
possibly break it. You know I enjoy
the theatre above all things, and I am
sure I should have an especially pleasant
evening with you.</p>

<div class="right">
"Sincerely,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Marian Reynolds</span>."<br />
</div>

</blockquote>

<p>Tom grew decidedly uncomfortable.
What the mischief was the matter with
the girl! One thing was certain, next
time he called, it would be at her invitation.
But the following afternoon found him
again at the house.</p>

<p>"Miss Reynolds is out, sir," said the
servant as he opened the door, in response
to his ring.</p>

<p>"I know," he responded impatiently;
"I want to return a book I borrowed the
other day."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," and the servant ushered
him into the library.</p>

<p>He put the book in its place, and his
glance, travelling downward met the
waste basket. Marian's distinctive penmanship
stared him in the face. "My
Dearest!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Drayton was an honourable
gentleman, but he wanted to examine that
waste-paper basket. He rushed out of
the library, lest he should yield to the
temptation, and said to the servant in
the hall: "Say nothing of my having
been here to-day, Jones."</p>

<p>"Certainly not, sir."</p>

<p>"The book is a joke on Miss Reynolds,"
he said putting a silver half dollar in
Jones's ready palm.</p>

<p>"All right, sir, I see." And Tom went
out.</p>

<p>Before he reached the avenue, he was
mentally kicking himself for explaining
to a servant. He had of course noticed
the roses on the table, and he was very sure
they had not been in Marian's room.</p>

<p>Once she had told him, how she had
slept with one of the roses next her heart,
and a thorn had pricked the flesh, making
a red spot on a white petal. She showed
him the rose with its tiny blood stain.
He had kissed the flower and put it in a
little memorandum book with a gold clasp.
And he had told Marian, over and over
again, what a horrid rose it was&mdash;to hurt
his sweetheart. He smiled grimly at his
own previous foolishness, and felt sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
that none of the American Beauties would
rest next to Marian's heart that night.</p>

<p>Miss Reynolds and Mrs. Bently sat in
the latter's boudoir. Edith nodded sagely
over Tom's note, and Marian was curled
up in a forlorn heap on the couch.</p>

<p>"How does he usually begin his notes
to you?"</p>

<p>"'My Dearest Girl,' or 'Dear Sweetheart,'"
answered Marian.</p>

<p>"H'm! Well, my dear, you may depend
upon it, he is 'beginning to take notice.'"</p>

<p>Sunday, Tom spent morosely at his
club, and was so disagreeable that his
friends were very willing to give him a
wide berth. Marian was neither cheerful
nor happy, and wept copiously in private,
fancying Tom worshipping at the shrine
of Miss Perkins.</p>

<p>Monday evening she and Edith dressed
together. Marian had a new gown of
that peculiar shade of blue which seems
to be especially made for brown eyes and
hair, and looked, as her friend told her,
"simply stunning."</p>

<p>"Joe has a box at the theatre to-night.
Isn't he lovely?"</p>

<p>Marian assented, but inwardly hoped
that Tom would not hear of her being there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Sterling Jackson was a very pleasant
fellow, with an inexhaustible fund of
humour. He devoted himself to Marian
and looked unutterable things whenever
opportunity offered. Handsome, he certainly
was, and she was secretly flattered
by his evident adoration. Tom didn't
matter quite so much now.</p>

<p>At the theatre Marian sat in the front
of an upper box beside Mrs. Bently. The
devoted Jackson leaned forward and talked
to her in subdued tones. After the first act,
Edith whispered to her:</p>

<p>"Don't look, nor turn pale, nor do
anything rash, but Mr. Thomas Drayton
is down in the parquet with Miss Matilda
Perkins." Marian turned white and
grasped the rail of the box. "Don't faint
till I tell you. He hasn't taken his eyes
off you since he first saw you, and I don't
believe he has seen the stage at all.
Perkins is simply green with rage, and I
wish you could see her hat. It's a dream
in pink and yellow&mdash;an equine dream."</p>

<p>Marian's colour returned, and conscious
of looking her best, she flirted outrageously
with the ever willing Jackson, though she
confided to Edith at the end of the second
act, that she was "perfectly wretched."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nobody suspects it," returned Mrs.
Bently, "least of all Tom. He's chewing
Perkins's fan, and she's trying to draw
him out."</p>

<p>For the remainder of the week Mr.
Drayton studiously avoided the Reynolds
mansion. Marian had been seen on the
Boulevard with the odious Jackson, and
Miss Perkins had suddenly lost her charm.
Marian was always at home on Tuesdays.
Next week he would drop in, in the afternoon,
and see how the land lay.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bently had heard, through her
husband, that Drayton had gone out of
the city, and the intelligence was promptly
conveyed to Marian.</p>

<p>The solitaire lay in a corner of Marian's
chatelaine bag. She meditated the propriety
of sending it back, but Edith would
not hear of it. Her heart ached constantly
for Tom, and she flirted feverishly with
Jackson. "I am at home Tuesdays," she
said one evening when he left her. "Come
in for a little while and I will give you a cup
of tea."</p>

<p>He came early and found her alone.
They chatted for a few minutes, and then
Mr. Thomas Drayton was announced.
The two men were civil to each other, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Marian felt their mutual irritation, and
was relieved when Jackson rose to take
his departure. He crossed the room to
Tom and shook hands. "I am very glad
to have met you, Mr. Drayton. I am
sure we shall meet often, if you find Miss
Reynolds as charming as I do." He bowed
politely to Marian and went out.</p>

<p>"The insufferable cad!" thought Tom.
He shivered, and Marian hastened to the
tea table.</p>

<p>"It's awfully cold outside," she said,
"and these rooms are not any too warm.
I'll make you some tea. You take two
lumps of sugar, don't you?"</p>

<p>Tom said nothing. Marian's pretty
hands hovered over the teacups, and he
noticed that the left one was ringless.</p>

<p>"Don't you wear your solitaire any more,
Marian?" His voice was strange and
she was half afraid.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she responded brightly,
"sometimes. The points of the setting
catch in my glove though, and I am afraid
of loosening the stone."</p>

<p>"Marian, don't you care for me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"As much as you care for me, I think,
don't you?"</p>

<p>He went over and put his arm around
her. She shrank a little at his touch, but
he pulled her down on the sofa beside
him.</p>

<p>"Marian, darling, tell me what the
matter is. I know I don't deserve you,
and I'll go, if you say I must. Has that
fellow Jackson come between us?"</p>

<p>Marian disregarded one of Edith's injunctions.
"Perhaps it's Miss Perkins."</p>

<p>Tom said a very emphatic swear word,
which does not look well in print, then
buried his head in one of the sofa cushions.
She was frightened and sank down on her
knees beside him, her armor of self-defence
vanishing in womanly pity. "Tom, dear
Tom! What is it? Tell me!"</p>

<p>He straightened up and lifted her to the
sofa beside him.</p>

<p>"I see, sweetheart, I've been a fool and
a great deal worse than that. Can you
ever forgive me?"</p>

<p>"One thing first, Tom, do you love me?"</p>

<p>"Marian, dear, I never knew until this
last wretched week, just how much you
meant to me. I am yours, body and soul,
to do with what you will. I have no right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
to insult you, Marian, but will you take
me back?" His voice trembled with the
agony of love and pain, as she drew the
solitaire out of the chatelaine bag at her
belt. She held it silently toward him.</p>

<p>"Darling, is it good-bye?"</p>

<p>"No, dear, I want you to put it back."</p>

<p>And that evening, in accordance with
instructions, the servant said to Mr.
Sterling Jackson, "Miss Reynolds is out."</p>

<h2>Tr√§umerei</h2>


<p>He stood at the side of the brilliantly
lighted opera-house with a note-book
and pencil in his hand. Would that interminable
symphony never be finished? The
audience listened breathlessly, but he,
the musical critic of a thriving daily paper,
only drummed idly with his fingers
and stared vacantly at the people near
him.</p>

<p>There was a momentary hush, the orchestra
leader waved his baton, and the
trained musicians, with perfect precision
began the brilliant <i>finale</i>. The
audience was unusually sympathetic, and
for an instant after the closing passage
all was still; then came a great burst of
applause.</p>

<p>The leader bowed his acknowledgment,
but the clamour only increased. The
critic sank wearily into an empty seat
and looked across the house. He started
and grew pale, as among the throng of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
fashionables he saw a face that he knew&mdash;that
he had known.</p>

<p>A sweet face it was too; not beautiful,
but full of subtle charm and a haunting
tenderness that he had tried to forget.
He sat like one in a dream, and did not
know that the orchestra was about to play
the next number till its opening measures
woke him from his abstraction.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i-182a.jpg" width="600" height="185" alt="Music" />

<p>Tr√§umerei! Anything but that! Oh,
God, this needless pain! And he thought
he had forgotten!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i-182b.jpg" width="600" height="181" alt="Music" />

<p>He stood again in a little room which
the autumn moonlight made as bright as
day. Down below on the rocks was the
far-off sound of the sea, and she, with his
roses on her breast, sat before the piano
and played dreamily, tenderly, yes, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
same Tr√§umerei that was now breaking
his heart.</p>

<p>He had stood behind her, with his arms
around her, his dark, eager face down
close to hers, and whispered huskily:
"Sweetheart, I love you."</p>

<p>And she had turned her face up to his
and said, softly, "I love&mdash;you&mdash;too&mdash;dear;"
and he had hugged her tightly
to him and covered her face with burning
kisses that were almost pain. And&mdash;that&mdash;had&mdash;been&mdash;their&mdash;betrothal.
Then
for a little while there was happiness&mdash;then
there was a misunderstanding&mdash;and
there&mdash;she was&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Up through those arches of light the
clear, sweet melody stole. Had he forgotten?
Had she? He seized his opera-glass
and a quick turn of the screw
brought her again close to him.</p>

<p>Yes, there were tears in her eyes; he
could see the white lids quiver, and her
lips trembled and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>With a deeper throb of pain than any
he yet had known, the buried love came
back, strong and sweet, as in those
dear days when the whole world seemed
aglow with love of her.</p>

<p>He rose and walked nervously around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the shining circle and down the aisle to
where she sat. His breath came quick
and fast, he hardly dared trust himself
to speak, but with a great effort he commanded
himself and bent over her chair.</p>

<p>She looked up and her tear-wet eyes
met his own. He whispered, hoarsely,
"Forgive me&mdash;come out a minute&mdash;I
want to speak to you."</p>

<p>Hardly knowing what she did, she
followed him into the dimly lighted,
deserted foyer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i-184.jpg" width="600" height="187" alt="Music" />
</div>

<p>With the last strain of that wordless
love-sweet song, the dear old dream
came back and, unrebuked, he put his arm
about her once more.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart," he said, "I love you."</p>

<p>A soft arm stole round his neck, and
she answered as of old,</p>

<p>"I love you, too, dear."</p>

<h2>"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"</h2>


<p>Down in the negro quarters on a Georgia
plantation stood a quaint little log
cabin overlooking cotton fields that were
white with their snowy fruit. Born in slavery,
living in slavery and apparently destined
to die in slavery, yet old Joe was
happy; for to him slavery was not bondage&mdash;only
a pleasant way of being cared for.</p>

<p>His days of active usefulness were over.
He had served long and faithfully in those
same cotton fields, then as a house servant
and later as a coachman. Now on account
of age and the "misery" in his back, he
spent his days in mending harness, telling
stories to the children and making playthings
out of the odd bits of rubbish they
brought him.</p>

<p>His wife, Sally, was head cook at the
mansion which stood in another part of
the plantation, in the midst of trees and
flowers. Down a little farther was a tiny
brook that sang all the livelong day and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
turned back, regretfully perhaps, to wind
by the window of old Joe's cabin.</p>

<p>"The Pines" was a most hospitable
house and usually thronged with guests,
for its young mistress had an indulgent
husband and money sufficient to gratify
every possible whim. Mrs. Langley she
was now, but to old Joe she would be
"Miss Eunice" always. He had carried
her when she was a baby, watched over
her when she was ill, and once when a pair
of maddened horses dashed down the drive,
utterly beyond their owner's control, he
had snatched the unconscious child from
almost under the wild feet, and&mdash;saved
her life, they said, but the brave fellow
had received internal injuries and had not
been able to do much since.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said one afternoon, to an
appreciative audience of pickaninnies and
white children who sat together around
his feet in a truly democratic fashion,
"dat ar day war a great time fo ol Joe.
I war jes agwine to de house wen I see
dese yer hosses comin <i>ker-blip</i>! right whar
Miss Eunice war a playin wid her doll-buggy.
Dere wasn't no time to call her,
so I jes grab her and run, an my foot ketch
in de doll-buggy an I trow Miss Eunice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
ober my haid in some soft grass an den
de hosses tram on me an I kinder lost
my 'membunce. Pretty soon I fin mysel
in de house an de doctor an ol Missis war
a standin ober me. Doctor say, 'he come
to all right,' an ol Missis, she jes stoop
down an kiss ol Joe! Tink ob dat!"</p>

<p>"Den Miss Eunice come in, an ol Missis
say 'come here dear, and see Uncle Joe.
He done sabe yo life.' An den I lose my
'membunce again. One day Mas'r walk
in an he say, 'Joe, here's yo papers, yo's
free now, jus ez free ez I is.' I say Mas'r,
I don't want to go away from you an
Missis an Miss Eunice. I want to stay
here on de ol plantation, along 'o my ol
woman. And den he wipe is eyes an
say, 'I'll gib Sally papers too' an Sally
say, 'No Mas'r, me an Joe don't want to
be free; we wants to stay here where we's
happies' an Mas'r say he keep dose yer
papers for us till we done want em. Dose
was mighty fine times for ol Joe!" and he
beamed at the children around his feet
who had been listening with ever-fresh
delight to the old, old story.</p>

<p>"Now play something, Uncle," the
children cried, and Tommy Langley
brought the fiddle that always hung in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
one corner of the cabin. His eyes brightened
at the sight of the old brown thing,
but he gently put the eager child away,
saying, "No, honey, not dis time. I got
de misery in my back wuss en eber. Go
way, chillens, ol Joe's&mdash;so tired!"</p>

<p>They obediently trooped out of the
cabin and the old man's head dropped
on his breast. The gaunt grey figure
twisted with pain, and he did not move
until Sally came in to get his supper.</p>

<p>"Well, honey," she said cheerily, "how's
yo back to-day?"</p>

<p>"Pears like de pain gets wuss, Sally,"
he replied.</p>

<p>"Nebber yo min, yo'll get better byme
by." Coming closer she dropped a
bundle of illustrated papers into his lap.
"See wat Miss Eunice send yo, an look
here!" She pointed proudly to her
stooped shoulders, where a scarlet kerchief
shone like a ray of light in the dim cabin.</p>

<p>Joe tried to smile, then said feebly,
"Miss Eunice mighty good to us, Sally."</p>

<p>Sally assented, and moving quickly
about the cabin, soon had the evening meal
on the table.</p>

<p>"Come, Joe, move up yo cheer. Dis
yere hoe cake done to de tu'n!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pears like I couldn't eat no supper,"
he said, then gave a half-suppressed
groan that betokened an extra twinge of
the "misery."</p>

<p>"Po ol man," said Sally sympathetically,
and she ate in silence, watching the kindly
pain-drawn face, with ever-increasing
anxiety.</p>

<p>As twilight fell, the sufferer sought his
couch, where he moaned and tossed
restlessly, and the pitying Sally, stretched
wearily on a faded rug near the door was
soon fast asleep.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Up at "The Pines" all was light and laughter
and music, for a crowd of young folks
were gathered 'neath its hospitable roof
and guitars and mandolins made the whole
house ring with melody of a more or less
penetrating quality. In the midst of the
gaiety, Tommy stole up to his mother
with a troubled look on his usually merry
little face.</p>

<p>"What is it, dearie?" she asked, putting
her arm about him.</p>

<p>"Mamma, I'm afraid Uncle Joe is
going to die. His 'misery' hurts him
awful."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is Uncle Joe very sick, dear? I knew
he was not well, but he has always been
ailing, you know. I'll have the doctor
see him to-morrow."</p>

<p>"All right, mamma," and the little face
grew bright again.</p>

<p>She kissed him tenderly and said: "Run
away to bed, little son, the birds went long
ago."</p>

<p>Tommy went off obediently, but Mrs.
Langley felt worried about the faithful
old fellow who had saved her life. "I'll
see to him to-morrow," she thought and
began to plan various things for his comfort
and happiness.</p>

<p>A little later a pretty girl with a mandolin,
said: "Do you know I feel like
having a lark. Excuse the slang, please,
but there's no other word that will express
my meaning."</p>

<p>"Try a swallow," suggested a young man
in a way that was meant to be funny.
"There's lots of lemonade left in the
pitcher."</p>

<p>She scorned the interruption. "I want
a lark, a regular lark!"</p>

<p>"How would a serenade do?"</p>

<p>"Capital!" she laughed. "Just the
thing! We'll take our mandolins and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
guitars into the moonlight and make
things pleasant generally."</p>

<p>"But," said a maid with a practical
turn of mind, "who is there to serenade?
There aren't any neighbours, are there?"</p>

<p>"Give it up!"</p>

<p>"Ask Mrs. Langley&mdash;she'll know," and
a smiling ambassador from the merry
group, Mrs. Langley's own nephew, went
to the fair-haired hostess who sat with
her husband in the library.</p>

<p>"Aunty, who is there in this charming
spot whom we can serenade? The girls
think it would be fun, but we don't know
where to find a victim in this isolated
Eden."</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley rose quickly, and going to
the little party, told them of old Joe and
how she owed her life to those strong arms.
She finished the story with an eloquent
gesture that brought tears to the eyes of
many, and added: "Go down to the old
man's cabin and sing the quaint negro
melodies he loves so well&mdash;that he used
to sing to me when I was a little child.
And take these roses with you; he used to
love them so; you can throw them in at
the open window."</p>

<p>As she spoke, she took a great handful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of white roses from a vase and with a little
pearl-handled knife, dextrously removed
the thorns, then handed them to her
nephew.</p>

<p>"How do we get there, Aunty?" he
asked, with something like a tremor in
his voice.</p>

<p>"Follow the brook," she replied. "It
flows right under his window, and you
cannot miss the place. I'd go with you,
only I can't sing, and wouldn't be of any
use." She smiled brightly at them as
they went down among the shadows, then
to the tiny brook that seemed like a
musical stream of silver in the moonlight.</p>

<p>The party was strangely silent for one
bound for a "lark," and by much crossing
of the little stream that wound its
tortuous way through the grounds, they
came to Uncle Joe's tiny cabin in an
unseen nook of the plantation. They
grouped themselves under the window
in silence.</p>

<p>"Now then!" whispered one of them.
The mandolins and guitars played the
opening strains of the sweet old melody,
then their fresh young voices rose high
and clear:</p>

<p><br />The old grey head turned feebly on its
hard pillow, and Sally stirred restlessly.</p>

<p><br />Above the song of the brook that seemed
like a tender accompaniment to the tinkle
of the mandolins the music rose, and old
Joe woke from his dream of pain.</p>

<div class="caption">Swing low, sweet char-i-ot,<br />

<p><br />The fragrant shower fell around him.
He grasped a great white rose that was
within reach of his hand and pressed it
to his parched lips.</p>

<img src="images/i-197.jpg" width="600" height="131" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Swing low, sweet char-i-ot.</div>
</div>

<p><br />The song died away, and the singers
heard no sound within.</p>

<p>But the tired head fell back upon its
pillow with a sigh of infinite content, the
chariot came, and Uncle Joe forgot the
"misery" and the roses alike in passing
from supreme shadow to supreme dawn.</p>

<h2>The Face of the Master</h2>


<p>In a little town in Italy, there once lived
an old violin maker, whose sole pride and
happiness was in the perfect instruments
which he had made. He had, indeed, a son,
or rather a stepson, for his wife had been
a pretty widow with this one child when
he married her a year before.</p>

<p>Pedro was a dark little fellow, with
great deep eyes which seemed to hold a
world of feeling and sometimes sadness.
He idolised his mother, but shrank from
his father with a feeling of instinctive
dislike. Perhaps the old man noticed
this, though he was so absorbed in his
work and in directing his careless assistants
that he seemed entirely oblivious to his
surroundings.</p>

<p>The child was errand-boy for the little
shop, and all his tasks were patiently
and cheerfully done. Occasionally, one
of the workmen would pat him on the
head, and he distinctly remembered one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
day when the lady next door, gave him a
piece of candy.</p>

<p>Before he and his mother came to live
in the little shop, he had never seen a
violin, and even now he could not be said
to have heard one, for neither his father
nor any of the workmen knew how to play;&mdash;they
were quite content with putting
the bridge in place, leaving the strings
to be adjusted in the neighbouring town
where the instruments found a ready sale.</p>

<p>One day, the last touch was given to an
unusually fine instrument, and in a moment
of pride, the old man fitted it with strings.
He placed it under his chin and touched
the strings softly with the bow. Faulty
though the touch was, the answer was
melody&mdash;a long sweet chord.</p>

<p>Pedro's eyes grew darker, and his little
face was fearlessly upturned to the man
who held the singer of that wonderful
song. In the ecstasy of the moment, his
foot touched a valuable piece of wood upon
the floor.</p>

<p>Crack! It became two pieces instead
of one, and with a curse and a blow, the
trembling child was pushed, head foremost,
into his own little room. A moment later
he heard the key turn in the lock. Pale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
and frightened, he sank into a corner, but
the memory of the sweetness was with
him still and in his soul was the dawn of
unspeakable light.</p>

<p>All was silent in the shop now, but
shortly he heard the busy hum of voices
and the old confused sound. Then above
the din, the violin sounded again. He
listened in wonder. That single chord
had been a revelation, and as a sculptor
sees in a formless stone the future realisation
of a marble dream, so Pedro, guided
unerringly by that faulty strain, saw
through break and discord, the promise
of a symphony.</p>

<p>He fell asleep that night haunted still
by that strange sweet sound, and dreamed
that it had been his fingers to which the
strings had answered. <i>His</i> fingers? He
awoke with an intense longing in his
childish breast. Oh, to touch that dear
brown thing! Oh, to hear again the
whisper of the music!</p>

<p>Though the sun had risen he was still
in a dream, and, mingled with the notes
of the lark above his window, was the
voice of the violin.</p>

<p>Presently his stepfather appeared in
the doorway, and with more than usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
unkindness in his tone ordered him away
on an errand. Pedro gladly went, and
all that day tried ineffectually to conciliate
the angry man by patience, gentleness, and
obedience. Night came, and though weary,
he was sent on a still longer journey. He
started with an important message from his
father to the home of the man who was to
furnish wood for a lot of new violins. He
had often been to the shop, but it
was late now, the man must have gone
home, and his house was much farther
away.</p>

<p>He dared not complain, however, and
trudged wearily on. But with all his
fatigue, his heart was light, for he fancied
there might be music in the home toward
which he was hastening. Some day, perhaps,
he might hear the blessed chords
again! He would wait. Through his childish
fancy flitted a dream of a symphony&mdash;the
unthought melody which might be
sleeping in those broken chords.</p>

<p>He delivered his message safely, and the
man kindly showed him a short cut home.
It was very late, and the streets were
still, but he was not afraid. He passed
house after house that was gayly lighted,
and looked longingly at the revelry within,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
but he hurried onward till he came to a
little house in a side street.</p>

<p>Hark! He stopped suddenly. Out of
the darkness came the sound of music&mdash;was
it a violin? Yes, no, it could not be.
He crept closer to the cottage. Then a
burst of harmony came into his consciousness&mdash;long,
sweet, silvery notes; a glad rush
of sound that brought tears to his eyes&mdash;a
delicate half hushed whisper, and then
the twinkle of a brook, with the twilight
gentleness of a shadow. Clearer and
stronger the music grew, and the child's
breath came in quick, short gasps. The
brook was a river now, he could hear the
swaying of the trees in the forest; the
heart of the wind was in the music, and
on it swept in glad resistless cadence,
from the brook to the river, then down to
the sea. A pause, a long low note, then
a glorious vision of blue, as into the rush
of the song, there came the sweet, unutterable
harmonies of the ocean.</p>

<p>He was in ecstasy; he scarcely dared to
move. Oh, could he but see whence the
music came! Could he look for a moment
only, upon the face of the master! The
moon came out from behind a cloud, and
the child looked up. At the open window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
he saw an old man with deep-set eyes, a
kindly smile, and long white hair that
hung down to his shoulders. He held
a violin in his hand, but the picture needed
not this touch to tell the child who it
was that had made this wonderful music,
for he felt that he now looked upon the
face of the master.</p>

<p>With a sigh, the old man again placed
the instrument in position, and drew the
bow across the strings. The boy trembled.
In slow, measured sweetness the music
came&mdash;a deep wonderful harmony that
held him spellbound. There was a tender
cadence that swayed the player's soul,
and into the theme crept the passionate
pain of one who had loved and lost.</p>

<p>The child knew that the man was
suffering&mdash;that music like that could only
come from an aching heart. With double
notes, in a minor key, the master played
on; then the violin slipped to the floor
unheeded, and the old man laid his head
on the window sill, and wept like a child.</p>

<p>Pedro crept away; he could bear no
more. The glory had entered into his
soul. He went noiselessly to bed, but he
heard still that marvellous music and saw
again the pain-shadowed face of the master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, could he but touch the magic strings!
Could he but play one note of the wondrous
song! An idea seized him&mdash;he would try
sometime. In a transport of joy he fell
asleep, and dreamed all night long of the
heavenly strains. He saw the clear deep
blue of the ocean, he heard the wind symphonies
in the forest, and always, too,
before him was that white suffering face.</p>

<p>The next day he was scarcely himself.
He moved about as if he still slept, while
his eyes were unusually sad and thoughtful.
At night he could not sleep, and
after making sure that every one else
was in deep slumber, he slipped quietly
out into the shop. The moon showed
him where to go, and at length he picked
up the new violin which had taken so long
to finish, and which was the finest his
father had ever made. Where should he
go? Outdoors, assuredly. He went softly
out into the moonlight and down to the
brook which was some distance from the
house.</p>

<p>The silence, the beauty, the witchery of
it all, was overwhelming. A gentle breeze
swayed the tree tops, and, from the instrument
in his hand, drew forth √Üolian
music. He started, placed it in position,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and drew the bow across the wind-swept
strings. His touch awakened the sleeping
voice, and through his soul surged again
the long, sweet chords that had made him
glad, and shown him through the broken
bits of melody, the grandeur of the symphony.
Tenderly, tremblingly, he touched
the strings again, and another chord, a
minor, struck deep into his heart.</p>

<p>Without thought or knowledge of the
art he still blundered on, knowing naught
save that it was <i>his</i> fingers that made a
wild, delirious, rapturous sound, and seeing
only the remembered vision of the master's
face.</p>

<p>Conscious of nothing else, he did not see
that the sun had risen. Suddenly he looked
up. His father stood before him with a
strange expression on his face. The terrified
child dropped the instrument to
ward off a blow, but the father said, with
a tremor in his voice: "Is it so, my boy?
Are you then a musician? You shall
have lessons; I shall give you a violin; we
go to-day to see the master. Ah, the music!
It is most wonderful!"</p>

<p>The boy was dumb with astonishment.
To learn? And who was the master?
That afternoon he dressed himself in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
best garments, which were worn only on
festal occasions, and with his father went
on the gladdest errand of his life.</p>

<p>The master! Could it be? The child's
heart almost stopped beating. Yes, down
the little street they turned and went up
to the door of the cottage. He could not
speak.</p>

<p>Presently he found himself in a plainly
furnished little room, and heard footsteps
in the hall. The door opened, and Pedro
looked up to see those deep-set eyes that
seemed to smile down at him.</p>

<p>The father rose, and bowing low, he
said: "Signor, I would like my son to
play the violin&mdash;you are a teacher&mdash;he will
be a musician. I have no money, Signor,
but if you teach my boy how to play, I will
make you a violin&mdash;the finest in the world."</p>

<p>The master was about to refuse; his
old violin was a good one, and he did not
like to teach. He turned away hastily,
but he caught a glimpse of the child's
uplifted face. His soul was in his eyes,
and in their depths the great artist saw an
unutterable longing. He was touched.
"Child," he said, "would you like to play?"</p>

<p>He laid his hand on the boy's shoulder.
The touch and the kindly tone thrilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
him unspeakably. To play? To hear
again that infinite music? Glad tears
rushed to his eyes and his only answer
was a sob.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," the man's voice was tender.
"You love it; I will teach you. Come
to-morrow at this hour and we shall
begin."</p>

<p>Pedro went home, wild with delight.
To play! To see the master's face! Ah,
it was too much! All night long he
dreamed of that delicious melody, and the
dear old head with its crown of silver hair
that seemed like a benediction.</p>

<p>His father gave him a little old violin.
To him? Was it all his own? "And when
you can play, my boy," he said, "you shall
have the 'Beauty'."</p>

<p>Pedro's first lessons were a revelation.
His face was a study for a painter, and
the teacher saw that he had before him
the promise of an artist. He gave himself
willingly to the task and soon learned
to dearly love his eager pupil.</p>

<p>And Pedro? No task was too hard, no
study too difficult, no practice too long
and tedious, if he might please his good
old friend; and even while he struggled with
the difficulties of technique, he never lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
hope or patience, for before him always
like a guiding star, was the serene white
face of the master.</p>

<p>So the years went by, and all Italy was
being searched for the finest wood that
grew&mdash;for the sharpest tools. The wood
for the master's violin must be well seasoned&mdash;it
would take a long time&mdash;the
longer, the better. For centuries the old
tree had listened to wind, and river, and
bird; the sounds of the forest were interwoven
with its fibre, and now it must give
up its buried music in answer to the strings
of the violin.</p>

<p>The childish stature was changed to
that of manhood, and still the teacher
found in Pedro a devoted pupil. The
youth had developed in many ways, but
the artist seemed to be little changed.
A little more bent, perhaps, but the same
sweet soul.</p>

<p>Pedro had the "Beauty" but the
master's violin was not yet finished. He
never asked for it, never spoke of it; in
the delight of Pedro's achievement and
greater promise, perhaps he had forgotten
the promise of the old violin maker.</p>

<p>But the old man was growing feeble.
A change was coming and the young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
felt it too. He went one day for his lesson,
and the housekeeper met him at the
door with her finger on her lip. Hush!
The teacher was ill. But he would like
to see Pedro for a few minutes.</p>

<p>He went in and spoke tenderly to the
old friend, whose eyes shone with so much
love for his pupil&mdash;his boy&mdash;as he still
called him. Pedro could not stay long&mdash;it
was too sad, and the tears were choking
his utterance. He went home with a
sorrow-laden heart.</p>

<p>His father said to him as he entered:
"The master's violin is at last finished,
my son. See?"</p>

<p>He held up a beautifully fashioned
instrument.</p>

<p>"You shall take it to him to-morrow.
Ah, its tone! You will play?"</p>

<p>"No, father, I cannot. The master, he
is ill&mdash;dying&mdash;perhaps. Oh! I cannot."</p>

<p>The old violin maker laid the instrument
gently in its case. There were tears in
his own eyes&mdash;"The teacher! Well, we
must all die," and he turned to his work.</p>

<p>Night came, and Pedro tossed restlessly
on his couch. About midnight there was
a rap on the front door of the shop.</p>

<p>He went quietly and opened it. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
was a messenger from the old housekeeper.
The teacher was sinking fast. The physician
said he could not last until morning.
He was out of pain, and he knew the end
was near. Would Pedro come and play
for him? The night seemed so long!
Pedro dressed himself hurriedly. Oh, if
he should be too late! As he went
through the shop he passed the table where
lay the master's violin. A sob came into
his throat as he lifted it from the case.
He would play that.</p>

<p>Out into the still street he went with
almost breathless haste. The moon shone
gloriously, and the air was sweet with
spring. He reached the cottage and went
softly into the little room at the end of the
hall where the man lay, looking like a
piece of marble statuary, but still breathing.
Pedro bent over him and looked
lovingly into his face.</p>

<p>The master spoke with difficulty&mdash;"You
are come, then, my friend&mdash;my boy?"
The same old tenderness! Pedro could
not answer. "You will play to me? The
end is so near, the night seems so long&mdash;play
to me, my boy."</p>

<p>The feeble man turned his face to the
open window, which was on a level with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
couch. With a sigh of content, he laid
his head upon the sill. Pedro started.
The position, the moonlight, oh, that far-off
night! Again he was a child crouching
in the darkness, and in the old ecstasy
beneath that very window&mdash;he heard
again that infinitely sad music, and saw
again the white suffering face.</p>

<p>He placed the instrument in position;
step by step, unerringly, he followed the
notes of the marvellous melody, for was
not the musician before him, teaching
him how to play it?</p>

<p>The grey head turned towards the
player&mdash;a strange new light in his eyes.
But seeing only the vision of his childhood
the young man played on and on, and
somehow into the symphony crept all the
love and sadness of a life time. As
he played he threw his whole soul into
the music. Oh, the indescribable sweetness
of the master's violin! At last his vision
faded, and he saw the massive head drop
on the same old sill&mdash;he heard once more
the sobs that come with tears.</p>

<p>The music ended with a broken chord,
and he looked up&mdash;to find his friend
gazing at him with ineffable happiness.
"My boy, where did you learn that? It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
is one of my own compositions&mdash;I have
never written it all down&mdash;where&mdash;where
did you learn it?"</p>

<p>Pedro drew his chair to the couch, and,
clasping the withered hand in both his
own that were strong and young, and
beating with life, he told the story. So
long ago that he was but a child, he
had heard the artist play it. He had
known even then that it was born of sorrow,
and to-night that far-off time came
back into the moonlight, with the master's
face. He had not played from memory
only, for the teacher had shown him some
of the notes and he had but followed.</p>

<p>The man feebly raised his head and said
brokenly: "My boy, you are right; I had
a sorrow. You are young, but you will
understand."</p>

<p>No longer master and pupil, they were
now friend and friend.</p>

<p>"I loved her&mdash;the best of all the world.
But with the end only, came the peace
which had been denied me in life. She
loved my music and I played to her when
she lay dying. She did not love me as I
loved her&mdash;I was her friend, always; 'her
dear, dear friend,' she used to say.</p>

<p>"But," and the voice grew stronger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
"my arms were around her when the
angels came&mdash;with my kisses on her
lips she went to her grave&mdash;there are
violets there&mdash;she loved them so&mdash;for
thirty years I have watched them. Her
heart has blossomed into them, and they
come from her to me.</p>

<p>"She was so pure&mdash;so sweet&mdash;and her
last word was for me. Such a little word!
With her last strength, she put her arms
around me, and drew my face down to
hers&mdash;such a little word&mdash;it was a whisper&mdash;<i>Sweetheart</i>!
She loved me then&mdash;I know
she did. Oh, love, could I break the bonds
of the grave!" He was silent for a moment.
"Now you know&mdash;you understand. You
will play it again."</p>

<p>The night was deepening toward the
dawn. Once more Pedro took the violin&mdash;and
played the melody, instinct with
the old, old story of love and pain. The
man's eyes were closed; he lay contentedly
and peacefully as a child. As the
boy played, the darkness waned, and as
he finished, not with a broken chord, but
with a minor that some way seemed
completion, the first faint lines of light
came into the eastern sky.</p>

<p>The master turned to the window again:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
"See, the day breaks." The sky grew
gold and crimson, but a more celestial
light seemed to live around the grey head,
as if, in rifts of heaven, he saw her waiting
for him.</p>

<p>He stretched his trembling hands to the
east, and whispered: "Yes, I am coming!
Coming! You love me then? Ah, yes!
Beyond the sunset&mdash;the dawn; I am
coming&mdash;coming&mdash;coming&mdash;such a little
word&mdash;<i>Sweetheart</i>!"</p>

<p>A look of unspeakable rapture; it was
transfiguration; then the deep blue eyes
were closed upon the scenes of earth.
The first ray of the sun shot into the little
room and rested with loving touch upon
the couch. The sobbing old housekeeper
came toward them, but Pedro motioned
her away.</p>

<p>He knelt at the bedside, his own face
shining with something of that celestial
glow, and man though he was, with quivering
lips he kissed again and again the
dear white face of the master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<h2>A Reasonable Courtship</h2>


<p>When Tom Elliott graduated from
Harvard, that power of the mind
which is known as reason had become a
fetish with him. Every human action,
he argued, should be controlled by it.
The majority of people were largely influenced
by their feelings; he, Thomas
Elliott, twenty-six, good-looking, and fairly
wealthy, would turn his mental advantages
to good account and be guided wholly by
his reason.</p>

<p>He explained his theory to an attractive
young woman who had gone out on the
veranda with him. Partly because her mind
was too much occupied with the speaker
to comprehend the full purport of his
remarks, and partly because her feminine
tact forbade opposition to an unimportant
thing, Miss Marshall nodded her pretty
head in entire assent.</p>

<p>"It is an assured fact," he went on,
"that all the unhappiness in the world is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
caused by the inability to reason. Married
life is miserable just because it is not put
on a sensible basis. Any two human
beings capable of reasoning would be happy
together, if that point were kept constantly
in view. Perfect, absolute truthfulness,
and constant deductions from it, form the
only sure foundation for happiness. Am I
right?"</p>

<p>She twisted the corners of her handkerchief.
"Yes, I think you are."</p>

<p>Elliott paced back and forth with his
hands in his pockets&mdash;a symptom of nervousness
which women mistake for deep
thought; "Belle," he said suddenly, "I have
always liked you. You have so much more
sense than most girls. I am not going to
flatter you, but you are the only woman
I ever saw who seemed to be a reasonable
being. What I want to ask is, will you
try it with me?"</p>

<p>Miss Marshall opened her brown eyes
in amazement. Since she left boarding-school,
the approach of the Elliott planet
had materially confused her orbit. She
had often dreamed of the offer of Tom's
heart and hand, but for once, the consensus
of masculine opinion to the contrary,
a woman was surprised by a proposal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean?" she
gasped.</p>

<p>"Just this. You and I are congenial,
of an equal station in life, and I believe
we could be happy together&mdash;happier than
the average married couple. There's no
foolish sentimentality about it; we know
each other, and that is enough."</p>

<p>There was a terrific thumping going on
in the region where Miss Marshall had
mentally located her heart. She took
refuge in that platitude of her sex which
goads an ordinary lover to desperation.</p>

<p>"This is so sudden, Mr. Elliott! I
must take time to consider."</p>

<p>"Very well, take your own time. I'll
be a good husband to you, Belle, if you'll
only give me the chance."</p>

<p>In the solitude of her "den" Belle
Marshall gave the matter serious consideration.
Safely intrenched behind a formal
proposal, she admitted to herself that she
loved him&mdash;a confession that no woman
ever should make until the Rubicon has
been crossed. But even the most love-blinded
damsel could not transfigure
Elliott's demeanour into that of a lover.</p>

<p>Within her reach, in a secret drawer, was
a pile of impassioned letters and a withered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
rose; on her desk a photograph of a handsome
face, which she had last seen white
to the lips with pain. He had called her
cruel, and she had smiled faintly at the
Harvard pin which she wore, and bade him
go.</p>

<p>Then there was another, of whom Belle
did not like to think, though she went
to his grave sometimes with a remorseful
desire to make some sort of an atonement.
He was only a boy&mdash;and some women know
what it is to be loved by a boy.</p>

<p>She compared the pleading of the others
with Elliott's business-like offer, and wondered
at the severity of fate. Then she
wrote a note: "Miss Marshall accepts with
pleasure, Mr. Elliott's kind invitation
to become his wife," and sent it by a
messenger. Before burning her relics, as
an engaged girl should, she sat down to
look them over once more. With a
Spartan-like resolve she at last put every
letter and keepsake into the sacrificial
flames. When it was over she sighed,
for she had nothing left but memory and
the business like promise of the morning:
"I'll be a good husband to you,
Belle, if you'll only give me a chance."</p>

<p>Her note would doubtless be answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
in person, and she donned a pretty white
gown, that she might not keep him waiting.
She vainly tried to tone down her flushed
cheeks with powder. "You are a nice
sort of girl," she said to herself, "for a
reasonable marriage."</p>

<p>Just then the door-bell rang, and she
flew to answer the summons. There was
no one else in the house, the coast was
clear and she was an engaged girl. She
started in surprise, as Elliott walked
solemnly on by her, after she had closed
the door.</p>

<p>"Nice afternoon," he said.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it; Miss
Marshall had expected to be kissed.
Still unable to speak, she followed him
into the parlour. He turned to offer her
a chair and instantly read her thought.
"You need fear nothing of the kind from
me," he said in a blundering way, which
men consider a high power of tact. "It's
not hygienic, and is a known cause of
disease. Above all things, let us be
sensible."</p>

<p>"You got my note?" she enquired
faintly.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I came to thank you for the
honour conferred upon me. I assure you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
I fully appreciate it&mdash;more, perhaps, than
I can make you understand."</p>

<p>Throughout his call he was dignified
and friendly, but she was in a state of
nervous excitement which bordered on
hysteria.</p>

<p>"You are nervous and overwrought,"
he said in a friendly way. "Perhaps I
would better go. I'll come again soon,
and you shall name the day, and we will
make plans for our future."</p>

<p>He shook hands in parting, and Belle
ran up-stairs as if her life depended upon
it. Once in her own room, she locked
the door, then threw herself down among
her sofa pillows in a passion of tears.</p>

<p>"A&mdash;cause&mdash;of&mdash;<i>disease</i>&mdash;of&mdash;<i>disease</i>,"
she sobbed. "Oh, the&mdash;brute!"</p>

<p>She had kept her lips for her husband,
and the wound went deep. When she
descended the stairs, calm and collected,
her eyes were set and resolute, and there
was a look around her mouth that boded
ill for Mr. Thomas Elliott, of Harvard, '94.</p>

<p>The next day he asked her to drive.</p>

<p>"I don't want to hurry you in the least,"
he said, "and the time is left to you.
Only tell me a little time before, that is
all. And Belle, remember this: I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
going to be perfectly and absolutely
truthful with you, and I expect you to
be the same with me."</p>

<p>It was not long before she found out
that he meant what he said.</p>

<p>"Do I look nice?" she asked him one
evening, when they were starting for the
theatre.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say that you do not,"
answered Elliott. "You've got too much
powder on your nose, and that hat is a
perfect fright."</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed, but she said nothing.
Offering him her handkerchief she commanded
him to "wipe off the powder,"
and Elliott did so, wondering in a half-frightened
way, what the mischief was
the matter with Belle.</p>

<p>They were early, and sauntered along
the brilliantly lighted street, with plenty
of time to look into the shop windows.
One firm had filled its largest window with
ties of a dashing red.</p>

<p>"I think I'll get one of those," Tom said.
"They're stylish just now, and I think
it would be becoming, don't you?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," she answered promptly.
"Only a man with a good complexion
can wear one of those things!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom had always thought his dark clear
skin was one of his best points, and that
Belle should insinuate that it wasn't, hurt
his pride. Neither spoke until they entered
the theatre; then man-like he said
the worst thing possible.</p>

<p>"That's a pretty girl over there," inclining
his head toward a blond beauty. "I
always liked blonds, didn't you?"</p>

<p>Belle was equal to the occasion. "Yes,
I always liked blond men; I don't care so
much for the girls."</p>

<p>Elliott's lower jaw dropped thoughtfully.
He was as dark as Egypt, himself.</p>

<p>Neither enjoyed the play.</p>

<p>"Seeing it a second time has spoiled it
for me," Tom said. "I took Miss Davis
last week and we both enjoyed it very
much."</p>

<p>Belle's stony silence at last penetrated
Tom's understanding.</p>

<p>"There's no reason why I shouldn't
take another girl to the theatre," he explained,
"just because I happen to be
engaged to you. It isn't announced yet,
and won't be until you are willing. And
you know it doesn't change my regard for
you in the least to go with any one else.
You are welcome to the same freedom."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>A great light broke in upon Belle. The
next time he called she had gone to play
tennis with a Yale man. He saw them
laughing and chatting a little way down
the street, and the owner of the blue sweater
was carrying her racket. Tom was angry,
for the Yale man was an insufferable cad,
and she had no business to go with him.
He would speak to her about it.</p>

<p>On the way home, he wisely decided
to say nothing about it. Perhaps Belle
wasn't as fully accustomed to being guided
by reason as he was, though she was an
unusually sensible girl. He must be gentle
with her at first; she would grow by
degrees.</p>

<p>Acting on this impulse, he took his
cherished copy of Spencer's <i>Ethics</i> and
presented it to her.</p>

<p>"You'll like this," he said, "after you
have got into it, and it will help you
amazingly about reasoning."</p>

<p>A well-developed white arm threw the
Spencer vigorously against the side of
the house. Elliott was surprised, for a
woman like this was utterly outside the
pale of his experience. Perhaps she didn't
feel well. He put his arm around her.</p>

<p>"What is it, Belle?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>The singular phenomena increased in
intensity, for Belle jerked away from him,
with her eyes blazing.</p>

<p>"How dare you touch me?" she said,
and walked like an empress out of the room.</p>

<p>Inside of ten minutes the idea came to
Elliott that she did not intend to return
until he left the house. Her handkerchief
lay on the table, and he picked it up.
He looked carefully into the hall, and saw
no one. Then the apostle of reason put
the handkerchief into his pocket and
walked out of the room to the front door,
then slowly down the street, still in a
brown study. "What could a young
woman mean by such vigorous hints of
displeasure?" Four years at college had
taught him nothing of women and their
peculiar ways, and he was evidently on
the wrong track. It wasn't reasonable to
humour her in such tantrums, but he sent
a box of roses by way of a peace offering,
and received in return a note which emboldened
him to call.</p>

<p>An old-time friendly chat put them on
an equal footing again, and Elliott grew
confidential.</p>

<p>"Every thought of mine rightfully belongs
to you, I suppose," he said one day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"Every thought of mine <i>is</i> of you,"
she replied softly, and he watched the
colour in her cheeks with a sensation akin
to pleasure.</p>

<p>He thought about it in the night afterward.
It was nice for a fellow to know that
a girl like Belle thought of him often.
If it had been a proper thing to do, he
wouldn't have minded kissing her when
she said it, for he had never seen her look
so pretty.</p>

<p>The Yale man had gone back to college
and Elliott settled down in business with
his father. He and Belle were the best
of friends, and he looked forward with increasing
pleasure to the day which she had
not yet named. He planned a European
tour which he was sure would both surprise
and please her. He did not intend
to mention it until after the ceremony.</p>

<p>Surely no lover ever had a more reasonable
and attractive path to travel. Belle
was everything that could be desired.
When his visits were infrequent, she did
not seem to miss him, and&mdash;rarest quality
in woman!&mdash;never asked him any questions
as to the way in which he had spent the
time away from her.</p>

<p>Tom felt like a pioneer who had emancipated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
his sex by applying the test of
reason to every duty and pleasure in life.</p>

<p>The summer waned, and beside the
open fire in the long cool evenings she
seemed doubly attractive. In a friendly
way, he took her hand in his, as they sat
in front of the flaming brushwood, then
started in surprise.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The queerest thing," Tom answered.
"When I touched your hand just now, I
felt a funny little quiver run up that arm
to my elbow. Did you ever feel a thing
like that?"</p>

<p>Belle forsook the path of absolute truth.</p>

<p>"No, how queer!"</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" He took her hand again,
but the touch brought no answering thrill.
"Must have been my imagination, or a
chill," commented Tom.</p>

<p>Alone in her room, Miss Marshall
laughed softly to herself.</p>

<p>"Imagination, or a chill! What a dear
funny stupid thing a man is!"</p>

<p>Sunday evenings Tom invariably spent
with Belle. When he called on the first
evening of the following week, he was
astonished to find that she had gone to
church with the Yale man. Mrs. Marshall
explained to him that it was the young
man's farewell visit; his mother had been
ill and he had been unexpectedly called
home, thus giving him a few days with old
friends.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Must be very ill," said Tom ironically,
under his breath, as he went back to his
cheerless room.</p>

<p>There was a queer tightness somewhere
in his chest which he had never felt before
and it seemed to be connected in some way
with the Yale man. He slept fitfully and
dreamed of Belle in a little house, with an
open fire in the parlour, where he would be
a welcome guest and the alumni of the
other colleges would be denied admittance.
He was tempted to remonstrate with her,
but had no reasonable ground for doing so.
They would be married shortly and then
the matter would end.</p>

<p>The next time he went to see her, the
peculiar tightness appeared in his chest
again, and he could hardly answer her
cheerful greetings. He noted that she
had acquired a Yale pin, which flaunted its
ugly blue upon her breast. He trembled
violently as he sat down and drops of
perspiration stood out on his brow. She
was alarmed and brought him a glass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
water. As she stood over him, the womanly
concern in her face touched him
not a little, and he threw his arms around
her and drew her down to him.</p>

<p>"Kiss me once, Belle," he pleaded
hoarsely.</p>

<p>With a violent effort she freed herself.</p>

<p>"It's not hygienic," she explained,
"and frequently causes disease."</p>

<p>Tom stared at her in open-mouthed
wonder, and soon after took his departure.</p>

<p>Once inside his room, he sat down to
close analysis of himself. He had been
working too hard, and was temporarily
unbalanced. She was quite right in saying
that it caused disease; such a thing must
not happen. His reason had been impaired
by long hours in the office; otherwise
he would never have thought of doing
such a foolish, unreasonable thing.</p>

<p>In the morning he received a note from
her. She had been summoned to the
bedside of a sick sister, and would be away
from home as long as she was needed.</p>

<p>The next month was a long one for Tom.
He was surprised to find how much of his
life could be filled by a woman. After
they were married there would be no
such separations. He wrote regularly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
received in return such brief notes as her
duties permitted her to write. Then, for
a week, none came, and he went to her
home to see what news had been received
there. The servant admitted him,
half smiling, and in white house gown, by
the open fire he saw Belle. She had never
seemed so sweet and womanly, and with a
cry he could not repress, he caught her
in his arms. She struggled, but in vain,
and at last gave her lips willingly to his.
In that minute Tom learned more than
all his college course had taught him.
Utterly unconscious of his own temerity,
he kissed her again and again. The little
white figure was silent in his arms, and
bending low he whispered a word which no
reasonable man would ever be caught using.</p>

<p>Her face shining with tears, Belle looked
up.</p>

<p>"Tom," she said, "do you love me?"</p>

<p>"Love you!" he said slowly. "Why&mdash;I
guess&mdash;I must."</p>

<p>She laughed happily and he drew her
closer.</p>

<p>"Dear little girl," he said tenderly,
"do you love me?"</p>

<p>The answer came muffled from his
shoulder: "All the time, Tom!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"All the time! You darling! What
an infernal brute I have been!"</p>

<p>He evidently intended to kiss her again,
for he tried to lift her chin from his shoulder.
Providence has taught women a great
deal about such things. Her eyes flashed
with mischief as she struggled to release
herself.</p>

<p>"You must let me go, Tom; this isn't
reasonable at all!"</p>

<p>But his training with the Harvard crew
had given him a strength which kept her
there.</p>

<p>"Reasonable!" he repeated. "Reasonable
be hanged!"</p>

<h2>Elmiry Ann's Valentine</h2>


<p>"Si," said Mrs. Safford, "didn't Elmiry
Ann Rogers come in here to-day to
buy a valentine?"</p>

<p>"Yep," replied the postmaster, without
interest. "One of them twenty-five cent
ones, with lace onto it."</p>

<p>"I thought so," grunted the wife of
his bosom.</p>

<p>"How, now, Aureely? Why ain't she a
right to buy a valentine if she wants
one?"</p>

<p>"She's a fine one to be buyin' sech trash,
when everybody in The Corners knows
she ain't hardly got enough to keep soul
and body together, let alone clothes and
valentines. I knowed she'd done it, jest
as well as if I'd see her do it, 'cause she
aint' missed comin' in on the twelfth of
February sence we come here, and that
is nigh onto fourteen year."</p>

<p>"Well," said Silas, after a long silence,
"what of it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"Si Safford! do you mean to tell me
you've been postmaster for fourteen year
an' ain't never noticed that Elmiry Ann
Rogers <i>gets</i> a valentine every year?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Silas, turning to meet a
customer, "I ain't never noticed it."</p>

<p>"Men do be the beatenest," exclaimed
Aurelia under her breath.</p>

<p>"Evenin', Mr. Weeks."</p>

<p>"Evenin' Mis' Safford."</p>

<p>"Moderatin' any?"</p>

<p>"Nope, looks like snow, but I reckon
it's too cold."</p>

<p>For perhaps ten minutes the two men
talked the dull aimless commonplaces of
the country store. The single lamp with
a reflector behind it, made all three faces
unlovely and old. John Weeks was a tall
strapping fellow, slightly stooped, and
about fifty years old. His hair was grey
at the temples, but his eyes had a kindly
twinkle that bid defiance to time.</p>

<p>He bought some brown sugar and went
out. One could not blame him for seeking
other surroundings, for even at its best,
the post-office and general store at The
Corners was a gloomy place.</p>

<p>Two well-worn steps that creaked
noisily were the links between it and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
street. The door opened by an old-fashioned
latch, worn with much handling,
and inside, a motley smell greeted the
inquiring nostril unwonted to the place.</p>

<p>The curious sickish odour was a compound
of many ingredients blended into
one by the all-powerful and all-pervading
kerosene. The floor, moderately clean,
was covered with sand and saw-dust,
which was occasionally swept out and
replaced by a fresh layer.</p>

<p>On the right, as you went in, was a
small show-case filled with bright coloured
candies, displayed in the original packages.
Other boxes were piled in the window and
still others on the shelf. Within a radius
of twenty steps one could buy calico,
muslin, ruled stationery, or groceries and
kerosene, as he might choose.</p>

<p>Once a year, the commonplace merchandise
gave way to "Christmas novelties,"
and during the first two weeks in
February the candy show-case was filled
with the pretty nonsensical bits of paper
called valentines, with a pile of "comics"
on top.</p>

<p>Every year on the twelfth of February,
as Mrs. Safford had said, Elmiry Ann
Rogers came in and bought a valentine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Every year on the fourteenth of February,
as the postmaster's keen-eyed wife had
noted, Elmiry Ann Rogers had received a
valentine. It was no comic, either, such
as one might send to an unprepossessing
old maid of forty, but a gorgeous affair
of lace paper and cupids, in an ornate
wrapping, for more than once, Elmiry's
trembling fingers had torn the envelop a
bit, as if she could not wait until she
reached home.</p>

<p>In many a country town, the buyer of
the valentines would have been known
as "Ol' Mis' Rogers," but The Corners,
lazy, rather than tactful, still clung to the
name the pretty girl had gone by.</p>

<p>There was little in Elmiry to recall the
graceful figure that was wont to appear
in pink muslin or red merino at church
and prayer meeting, for the soft curves
had become angles, the erect shoulders
were bent, and the laughing eyes were
now filled with a dumb pathetic sadness.
Elmiry's hair had once fallen in soft curls
about her face, but now it was twisted into
a hard little knot at the back of her head.
The white dimpled hands were dark and
scrawny now, but people still spoke of
her as "Elmiry Ann."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>The morning of the thirteenth dawned
cloudy and cold. The postmaster went
out of town on business, and his wife
had her hands full. She moved briskly
from one part of the store to the other,
making change, rectifying mistakes, and
attending to the mail.</p>

<p>At noon a crowd of children came in
after "comics" and John Weeks stood by,
watching aimlessly.</p>

<p>"You want any valentines, Mr. Weeks?"
asked Mrs. Safford.</p>

<p>"Reckon not, I've been growed up too
long for that."</p>

<p>"Sho, now! You ain't much older 'n
Elmiry Ann Rogers, an' she buys one
every year. It's a nice one too&mdash;twenty-five
cents."</p>

<p>"I ain't never sent but one," said Mr.
Weeks, after a silence.</p>

<p>"That so? Well, some folks buys 'em
right along. Elmiry Ann Rogers gets one
every year jest as regler as a tea party."</p>

<p>"Who'd you advise me to send one to?"</p>

<p>"Don't make no difference to us, so we
sells 'em," laughed Mrs. Safford. "Stock's
runnin' down now, but if there's any lef
they can be kep' over. We've had one
now for goin' on five year. It's a fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
cent one, an it's pretty too. Elmiry's
looked at it every year but I guess it's too
expensive."</p>

<p>"Lemme see it."</p>

<p>It was the same size as the others but
it had more lace paper on it and more
cupids. Weeks was evidently pleased with
it and paid the fifty cents without a murmur.</p>

<p>"Makes me feel sorter silly to be buyin'
one o' them things," he said awkwardly,
"but I'm allers glad to do a favour for a
friend an' I'll take it off your hands."</p>

<p>"Much obliged," returned Mrs. Safford.
"Who you lowin' to send it to?"</p>

<p>Weeks considered carefully. "I've got
a little nephew over to Taylorville," he
said, "and I reckon he'd be right pleased
with it." Another avalanche of children
descended upon the valentine counter
and in the confusion he escaped.</p>

<p>Busy as she was, Mrs. Safford found
time to meditate upon Elmiry and her
romance. "They do say that John Weeks
used to set up some with Elmiry," she
thought, "and then it was broke off, but
there ain't either of 'em married. I sh'd
think he'd want a woman to do for him,
and poor Elmiry&mdash;her little house is most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
eat up by the mortgage. The squire
was a-sayin' the other day that he thought
she'd soon be on the town 'cause she ain't
paid the intrust lately. An her a-buyin'
valentines! La sakes! Well, it takes all
kinds of people to make up a world!"</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon she sorted the
mail, as usual, but there was nothing for
Elmiry. A strange fact of the case was
that the valentine had always come from
The Corners. Mrs. Safford began to hope
Elmiry would not be disappointed, then
the latch clicked, and she came in.</p>

<p>"I want half a pound of dried beef,
Mis' Safford," Elmiry said, "an' a quarter
of a pound of rice, an' a jug of merlasses,
an' a spool of black thread, number sixty."</p>

<p>"Would you mind writin' down your
order, Mis' Rogers? I'll send Si over
with it when he comes, 'cause I've got to
get this mail off in a few minutes an' I
ain't got time."</p>

<p>Elmiry seemed disappointed, but wrote
her needs on a piece of wrapping paper,
using the short blunt pencil which was
suspended by a piece of twine from the
show-case. Her writing was cramped,
old-fashioned, and as distinctive as it was
odd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>When Mrs. Safford had time to look at
the order, she became greatly excited.
"If that ain't the beatenest?" she said
to herself. "Who'd have thought it?
'Course, maybe it ain't, but I'm goin' to
make sure!"</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon Elmiry came in
again, and as before, she was the only
customer. "I jest thought I'd take my
things, Mis' Safford," she said by way of
explanation, "'cause I want to use some
merlasses right away and 't ain't no need
to trouble Mr. Safford, if you've got time
to do 'em up."</p>

<p>"I've got 'em all ready, Elmiry." So
Miss Rogers arranged the bundles under
her shawl and Mrs. Safford caught sight
of something white, held tightly in the
dark scrawny hand.</p>

<p>"'T want thread, nor rice," she thought,
as Elmiry went out, "and I know 't want
her handkerchief. I reckon 'twas her
valentine she was lowin' to send away,
and didn't, 'cause she thought I'd look.
She ain't goin' to fool me though."</p>

<p>Dusk brought the storm which had
threatened for two days, and a bitter
north wind came with it. In an hour
the world was white, and belated foot-falls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
were muffled by the snow. At nine
the store closed, and at half-past nine,
Elmiry Ann Rogers wrapped her threadbare
shawl around her and started down
the street to the post-office.</p>

<p>It was a difficult journey, for the snow
was three inches deep and was still coming
down, but Elmiry knew the way so well
that she could have gone with her eyes
shut, if necessary.</p>

<p>She was stiff with the cold when she got
there, and was fumbling with the opening
in the door marked "mail" when a deep
masculine voice at her elbow startled her
into an impulsive little scream.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Rogers," it said, "what are
you doin' here this time o' night?"</p>

<p>"My goodness, Mr. Weeks, how you
scairt me!" she answered trembling.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't be out a night like this,"
he continued, "it ain't fittin'."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I jest come out to mail a letter,&mdash;an
important letter," said Elmiry weakly.</p>

<p>"Why that's funny&mdash;so did I! Strange
that we should meet, ain't it? And now,
Miss Rogers, I'm goin' to take you
home."</p>

<p>"Oh, you mustn't, Mr. Weeks," cried
Elmiry in a panic, "I'd feel wicked to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
you out of your way a night like this, and
't'aint but a few steps anyway."</p>

<p>"Sakes alive! Elmiry, how you talk!
I'm a-goin' to take you home and we
might as well start. Come."</p>

<p>He slipped her arm through his and
turned down the street.</p>

<p>Elmiry felt a burning blush on her cold
cheeks, for it had been years, more than
she cared to remember, since any one had
taken her home.</p>

<p>As they went on, Mr. Weeks did the
talking and Elmiry endeavoured to collect
her scattered senses. There was something
strangely sweet in the feeling that
she had a protector, and she wondered
dimly how she had ever had the courage
to take the trip alone. When they reached
her door, she turned to bid him good-night,
but he seemed to take no notice of
it.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll go in an' set a spell," he
remarked. "I'm quite chill." Elmiry
had closed the door of the kitchen and
turned up the light which was burning
dimly before she remembered she had no
fire. Mr. Weeks opened the stove door
and found the interior dark and cold.
Then he looked behind the stove, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
there was neither wood nor coal and the
floor was spotlessly clean.</p>

<p>"Why, Elmiry," he said, "I'll go right
out and get you an armful of wood. It's
been stormin' so you've got out. I'll
bring in a lot of it."</p>

<p>"No, no," she cried. "Please don't!
It's too late for a fire to-night and in the
mornin' it'll be clear! Don't go!"</p>

<p>In her tone there was something more
than polite anxiety to save him the effort,
and he changed the subject. They talked
commonplaces until he felt the cold in
spite of his warm clothing. She still wore
her shawl and looked pitifully thin and
weak.</p>

<p>"Ain't you cold?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," replied Elmiry with great dignity.
"I'm warm-blooded an' most people keep
their houses too hot. It ain't healthy."</p>

<p>Mr. Weeks agreed and rose to go. She
did not ask him to come again, and he was
half-way down the street when he began to
wonder about the fire. The light was out,
so he went back, very slowly approached
the wood-shed by a roundabout way, entered
stealthily and struck a match, shading
the light with his hand.</p>

<p>On the floor, in the corner, was a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
small pile of kindlings and the coal-bin
was swept clean, no other fuel being in
sight.</p>

<p>"It's jest as I thought," he said to himself.
"The poor little soul!"</p>

<p>St. Valentine's morning was clear and
bright, but enough snow had fallen during
the night to obliterate the telltale tracks
around the wood-shed. Mrs. Safford
was up betimes, eagerly anticipating her
husband's peep into the soap box which
held chance letters posted after the store
had closed. There were two valentines
there, both addressed to "Miss Elmiry
Ann Rogers, The Corners."</p>

<p>"Sakes alive!" said Mrs. Safford. "Si!
Elmiry Ann Rogers has been a-sending
herself valentines every year, regler. I
wish 't I knew who t' other was from&mdash;this
is the first time she's had two."</p>

<p>"How'd you know anything about
it?"</p>

<p>"Why one on 'em is in the same hand
that was on the order she wrote, but
t' other looks like a man's hand."</p>

<p>"Aureely," said the postmaster, "you
keep still about valentines and everything
else you see in the mail, or I'll lose the
post-office, and you'll go to jail! The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
United States government don't stand no
foolin'!"</p>

<p>Awed by her husband's stern manner,
Mrs. Safford decided to keep still, but she
watched Elmiry Ann closely when Silas
gave her the valentines. The thin sad
face lighted up with pleased surprise,
but Elmiry did not stop. She clutched
her treasures tightly and hurried out
looking younger than she had for years.</p>

<p>When John Weeks came in during the
afternoon the Saffords were putting away
the valentines. "This fool business is
over for another year, John," said the
postmaster. "We've sold one we've had
for more'n five years. What you steppin'
on my feet for, Aureely? Ain't you got
room enough in the store to walk?"</p>

<p>"'Scuse me Si, there's the squire comin'
in."</p>

<p>"Mornin', Squire."</p>

<p>"Mornin', Si. Has your clocks stopped,
so's you don't know it's afternoon?
How's biz?"</p>

<p>"Oh, so so. What's new?"</p>

<p>"Nothin', only the selectmen held a
meetin' yesterday an' Elmiry Rogers is
a-goin' to the poorhouse. She's back
in her intrust, and ain't got no prospects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and the Doctor has got to foreclose.
They wanted I s'd tell her, but someways,
I don't like the idea. She'll be kep'
warm and she'll be better off, and she'll
have plenty of comp'ny, but I knowed
her when she went to school, an' I
knowed her mother too. For the sake
of auld lang syne I don't want to hurt
her."</p>

<p>"Sho now, ain't that too bad?" said
both the Saffords together.</p>

<p>Nobody knew just when Mr. Weeks
left the store, and Elmiry Ann was
startled when she opened the door in response
to his vigorous rap. She had not
been at home long, and the colour still
burned in her cheeks. The valentines lay
on the table, presenting a strange contrast
to their bleak and commonplace surroundings.</p>

<p>"Why, how do you do?" she exclaimed
with a queer little note in her voice.
"Will you come in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll come in," he said decisively.
He shut the door with a bang and took
the trembling frightened woman into his
arms.</p>

<p>"Elmiry! You poor little soul! I've
wanted you 'most twenty years, an' I ain't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
never had courage to say it 'til now.
We've waited too long, an' I want you
to come and be my valentine&mdash;will you,
dear?"</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Weeks," she cried in
astonishment, "what's took you all of a
sudden?"</p>

<p>"It's sense, I reckon, Elmiry, an' it's
been a long time comin'. I was huffed
'cause you never made no answer to the
valentine I sent you, an' I thought you
didn't want me, so I just stayed away."</p>

<p>"What valentine?" Elmiry's eyes were
very big and fearful.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember that valentine
I sent you?&mdash;Let's see, it's so long ago&mdash;I've
most forgot what it was. It said:</p>

<div class="poem">
"'The rose is red, the violet blue,<br />
Pinks are sweet and so are you;<br />
Give me your heart, you have mine&mdash;<br />
Will you be my valentine?'"<br />
</div>

<p>"Yes," said Elmiry slowly, "I remember."
She went to the Family Bible
which lay on the marble-topped table in
the front room and took it out. It was
worn and faded and there were spots on
it which looked like tears. "Did you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
mean that," she asked with difficulty, "for
a-a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," answered John, "an' I
thought it was cunnin', but I see now,
what a blamed fool I was. I should have
come and asked you like a man an'
not trusted to your understandin' no fool
valentine. I made a great mistake&mdash;Elmiry,
dear, won't you never forgive me?"</p>

<p>The poor little old maid smiled through
her blinding tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, John," she said, "I've waited so
long!" Then she broke down and sobbed
helplessly in his arms.</p>

<p>Elmiry forgot the empty years, and the
pathetic valentines, so dearly bought&mdash;it
was so sweet to be loved and taken care
of by a masterful man.</p>

<p>Neither heard the jingle of sleigh-bells
'till a voice shouted:</p>

<p>"Whoa," outside, and Doctor Jones
started towards the gate.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" said Elmiry.</p>

<p>"It's the Doctor&mdash;he wants to see me
about something and I'll go right out."</p>

<p>"No, I'm sure it's me, he wants to see,
John," said Elmiry sadly.</p>

<p>"'Tain't neither. He see me a-comin'
here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Without stopping to put on his overcoat
Weeks rushed out slamming the door
behind him, as he went. The conversation
was brief, but to the point, and
presently the Doctor drove off with a smile
on his face.</p>

<p>"Didn't he want to see me, John?"
asked Elmiry tearfully.</p>

<p>"No, it was me, as I told you, but he
sent in his congratulations."</p>

<p>"His congratulations! Oh, John! What
did you tell him?"</p>

<p>"I told him," said John, taking her
into his arms, "that we was engaged an'
that you was goin' to be my valentine."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<h2>The Knighthood of Tony</h2>


<p>It was such a pretty bicycle! Tony
fondled the glittering spokes and examined
the pedals with the air of a connoisseur.
He forgot the hump on his
back, and his solitary little house on the
outskirts of the village in the joy of his
new possession.</p>

<p>Only the night before Mrs. Carroll had
sent for him and given it to him. "Arthur
wanted you to have it;" she said with a
tremor in her voice. Between Tony and
the delicate child for whom the wheel was
bought, there had been a strong bond of
sympathy. Tony was always ready to
talk to him, or to take him to the woods,
and Arthur was the only human being
Tony knew, aside from Mrs. Carroll, who
did not jeer at the hump on his back, or
shrink from him as though he were an evil
thing.</p>

<p>When Arthur died, Tony felt a terrible
sense of loss, although he was a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
in years and his friend was but a
child.</p>

<p>On account of his deformity, the wheel
was none too small. If he could only ride
it! He shivered as he thought of the
shout of derision which would inevitably
be his share, should he venture to ride it
through the village streets. But there was
the long smooth stretch of road which led
to the next town, and there were innumerable
paths through the woods that he
knew and loved. The people in the village
need never know that he had it. He
could ride out there and no one be the
wiser.</p>

<p>He pushed it into his bedroom and shut
the door. He had one other treasure&mdash;an
old flute; and in spite of the cruel
hump it was a very happy Tony who went
to sleep that night, with one hand stretched
out upon the saddle of the beautiful new
wheel.</p>

<p>His father had been a shoemaker and
by lifelong toil had left a little competence
to his son. Tony knew the trade also
and sometimes worked at it. All that he
was thus enabled to make by his own
efforts, he invested in books at the store
in the next town. He felt dimly that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
would not be right to use his father's
money in this way, but his own was a
different matter.</p>

<p>There was a tiny paint-box too, with
which he sometimes copied the pictures
in the books. On the white wall of his
bedroom was a poor copy of a Madonna,
whose beauty he felt, but could not
express. In some way, the Madonna took
the place of the mother he had never
known, and whose picture, even, he had
never seen.</p>

<p>Man though he was in years, Tony had
dreams of a soft hand brushing back his
hair, and sweet cool lips pressed against
his own. When he came back from his
weekly trips to the village store, stung to
the quick by the taunts and derisions of
his fellow-men, he had sobbed himself
to sleep many a time longing for that
gracious hollow in a woman's shoulder,
which seemed made for such as he.</p>

<p>With the first streaks of dawn, Tony
started for the woods with his bicycle.
There was a wide shady path, well hidden
by trees, and here, he made his first attempts.
It seemed a long, long time
before he could ride even a little way,
and the hard falls bruised, but did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
discourage him. Day after day, in the
early light, he led his silent steed to the
secret place and returned after nightfall
that none might see him.</p>

<p>The trees at the side of the path were
more of a help than a hindrance. Often
he had restored his balance by reaching
out to a friendly trunk. The feeling of
confidence which every bicyclist remembers,
came at last, and he rode up and down
the path, making the turns at the end with
perfect ease, until he dropped off from
sheer weariness.</p>

<p>The next day he took his flute and his
wheel and a bit of lunch into the woods.
He rode on the path until he was a bit
tired, and then sat down on the grass
and began to play. He knew no music
but what the birds had taught him, and
the simple little melodies he had heard his
father hum.</p>

<p>Call after call of the mocking-bird and
robin he imitated on his flute, until the
little creatures flocked around him as if
he had been one of them.</p>

<p>Tony found the purest pleasure in the
society of his feathered friends. They
never noticed his crooked body, but with
that unfailing sight which seems to belong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
to birds and animals, recognised the soul
within, and knew that they need have no
fear of him.</p>

<p>At that very minute, a robin was perched
upon the handle-bar of his wheel, his
bright eyes fixed upon Tony, who was
calling to him with his own voice in such
a wonderful way that the red-breasted visitor
was well-nigh dumb with astonishment.</p>

<p>With a sudden cry of alarm, Sir Robin
fluttered into a tree above and Tony
looked up to behold a strange and altogether
lovely thing.</p>

<p>It was only a pretty girl in a well-made
bicycle suit of blue corduroy, with her
wheel beside her, but to Tony she was
even more beautiful than the Madonna.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," she said; "but I simply
couldn't help stopping to listen."</p>

<p>Tony blushed uncomfortably but he
made no reply.</p>

<p>"It must be a great pleasure to be able
to call the birds to you like that," she went
on; "I really envy you the gift."</p>

<p>He was transfixed with delight. This
beautiful straight human being actually
envied him the tiny bit of music he could
make with his flute! His primitive hospitality
came to the rescue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?" he said timidly.</p>

<p>She was very willing to sit down, and
almost before he knew it, he found himself
telling her about his little cabin, the father
who brought him up, and how Mrs. Carroll
had given him the bicycle because he
had been good to her little boy before
he died.</p>

<p>She admired the wheel very much and
talked over its good points with Tony
until he felt perfectly at ease. She asked
him his name and gave him her own.
She was Miss Atherton, staying in a
house just outside the village with her
invalid brother.</p>

<p>The doctor thought the air of the woods
would be good for him, so she had "packed
up, bag and baggage," as she expressed it,
and brought her horse, bicycle, piano and
a trained nurse to the village for the
summer.</p>

<p>She wanted Tony to come and see them
the very next morning and bring his flute.
Her brother would enjoy the music and
he could come up on his wheel and stay
all day.</p>

<p>She waved her hand to him as she rode
away through the woods towards her home.</p>

<p>It was the first time Tony had ever been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
asked to visit any one except the little
boy who had died. He remembered every
detail of her face and dress, the velvety
softness of the corduroy, the tiny watch
at her belt, and the brown eyes, so much
like those of the Madonna, that he felt
as if he had known her always. But one
thing troubled him. She did not seem to
see the curve between his shoulders.
Perhaps it was because he was leaning
against a tree all the time she was there.
If she had seen it, she would certainly
have spoken of it. She might not make
fun of him, but she would surely have
pitied him, which was almost as bad.
Even Mrs. Carroll who was always kind,
did that. No, Miss Atherton had not
seen it, and his dread of her discovering
it was the one flaw in his present anticipations.</p>

<p>She, herself, in a pretty white gown,
welcomed him at the door. Mr. Atherton
lay in an invalid chair with a table at his
side, and shook hands graciously with Tony.</p>

<p>It was such a happy day! He learned
the first moves in chess and Miss Atherton
played a tender, running accompaniment
on the piano to the bird music he made
with his flute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>They all had luncheon on the wide
veranda and Tony had not dreamed such
dainty things were possible.</p>

<p>They talked of their travels in Europe
and Egypt, before Mr. Atherton was taken
ill, and showed him pictures of wonderful
things in the lands across the sea. She
read aloud and sang softly to the half-hushed
chords her brother picked out on
the guitar, and Tony in a perfect wilderness
of enjoyment, forgot all about his crooked
shoulders.</p>

<p>That day was the first in a long series of
happy ones. He learned to play chess
well enough to make himself a formidable
antagonist, and after Miss Atherton taught
him the notes on the piano he found them
on the flute, and began to play simple
melodies from the music. Sometimes they
all played together, very softly in the
twilight&mdash;piano, flute and guitar; until
it became time for the invalid to be wheeled
into his room. Sometimes even after
that, Tony would sit on the veranda while
she sang or talked to him. Through the
long night he dreamed of her, as many a
lover dreams of his sweetheart. Beautiful
Miss Atherton! He worshipped her from
afar off, as a child looks at a star.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Tony who knew where the violets
grew, and who in the dim silence of dawn
laid handfuls of them at her door. And it
was he who brought her a great sheaf of
pond-lilies, dripping and sweet.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tony!" she cried, "where do they
grow?"</p>

<p>His face flushed with pleasure. "I'll
take you there if you want to go."</p>

<p>"Indeed I do," she exclaimed, "can we
go on our wheels?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the best way, though it's
rough in some places."</p>

<p>"I don't mind that," she answered,
"come early in the morning and we'll
stay all day."</p>

<p>That afternoon he went to the village
store to buy his week's provisions. Half-a-dozen
men who were loafing in front of
it asked no better sport than to get him
into a corner, so that he could not escape,
and fling at him taunts and jeers about his
crooked body. It was fun to see the
sensitive face flush with anger, or quiver
with pain, and it was not until his self-control
was entirely gone and he sank in a
sobbing heap on the floor, that they let
him go.</p>

<p>The night was one of torture to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
It was not the mother he had never seen
who could comfort him now, but Miss
Atherton. His idea of heaven was a
place where he might always be within
the sound of her voice, within reach of her
hand, and where she would look kindly
upon him.</p>

<p>He was thankful that the way to her
house lay beyond the village and not
through it. He would never dare to
show himself there on his wheel. And
the road to the lilies ran through the woods;
none would see to-morrow when he went
there with her.</p>

<p>She was already on the veranda in her
bicycle suit when he rode up the next
morning. She tied a basket of lunch to
his wheel and a book to her own.</p>

<p>"You see we are going to stay all day,"
she said, "and I couldn't think of starting
without refreshment for body and mind.
My brother has an armful of new books
which came from the city yesterday, and
he didn't even hear me when I said good-bye."</p>

<p>They started, Miss Atherton chatting
busily and Tony too happy to speak except
in monosyllables. A turn in the road
brought them to a branch of the river, white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
with lilies in full bloom. She dismounted
with a little cry of delight. "Oh, how
white and sweet they are!"</p>

<p>Tony found a boat moored by the side
of the stream and they soon had gathered
a great sheaf of the golden-hearted censers,
rich with fragrance, which they covered
with cool ferns in the shade of the trees
until they should be ready to take them
home. Being collected early in the day
they were fresher and sweeter than if they
had been allowed to feel the heat of the
later morning sun.</p>

<p>The lilies well cared for, they sat down
under a tree and she read to him the story
of Launcelot. His brave deeds and manly
service, his love for Guenevere, and the
spirit of romance and knightly courage
which seemed to fairly breathe from the
pages, held Tony spellbound.</p>

<p>"Miss Atherton," he said wistfully,
as she finished, "I'd like to be one of those
fellows."</p>

<p>"You can be," she answered.</p>

<p>"How?" he asked, his eyes wide open
in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Any man is a knight," she said, "who
does what is given him to do, wisely and
well. It's not the horses and the armour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Tony, it's the man, and you can be as
brave and true as Launcelot, if you only
will. Never permit yourself to speak, or
even think slightingly of a woman, and if
you have the opportunity to help one,
do it at any cost. That's the foundation
of true knighthood and true manhood, too.
See, I give you my colours; be my knight
if you will," and she leaned forward
smilingly to tie a white fragrant scarf
around his arm.</p>

<p>But to her surprise, Tony burst into
tears. And then a part of his dream came
true, for Miss Atherton put her arm
around him and drew him close to her.
"Tony, dear, what is it? Tell me!"
With his face half buried in the sweet
comforting place he had longed for, but
had never known, he sobbed out all the
bitterness of his heart. He told her of
the taunts and jeers which made his
crooked life a burden&mdash;of all the loneliness
before he knew her, and someway too,
he told her of his longing for his mother
whom he had never seen, and whose place
he had tried to fill with the picture of the
Madonna.</p>

<p>That day in the woods gave Tony undreamed-of
strength. He even offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
to do Miss Atherton's errands at the
store.</p>

<p>They did not know that he was a knight
bearing his lady's colours&mdash;that he was in
her service and would be to the very end
of the world, for even death, he thought,
could never make any difference in his
loyalty to her. He was Launcelot and she
was Guenevere&mdash;it was his secret, and even
she must never know.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the summer he rode
up to Miss Atherton's with a great bunch
of goldenrod, which only he knew where
to find. She came to the door white and
worried. "My brother is very ill, Tony,"
she said, "and I have sent my groom for
the doctor, but he has been gone so long
that I fear something may have happened
to him. Would you go&mdash;on your wheel?"</p>

<p>For a moment, as the vision of the
village store, on the only street that led
to the doctor's house, with its crowd of
loafers came before him, Tony hesitated.
Would Launcelot hesitate with Guenevere
in need? "I'll go, Miss Atherton," he
said quietly.</p>

<p>Terror struck him as he came in sight
of the store and saw the men he most
feared, sitting in front of it. Mutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
praying for help, he bent to his pedals.
But they had seen him, and rushed out
into the street with a shout. It was
an easy matter for them to stop his
wheel.</p>

<p>"Let me go! Let me go!" he cried,
"Miss Atherton's brother is sick, and I'm
going for the doctor!"</p>

<p>"That's a likely story," said one of
them. "Bet a hat you stole this velocipede.
She wouldn't send a hunchy like
you anywheres."</p>

<p>"Mebby she might," said the keeper
of the store. "That's the city gal he's
goin' to marry. I seen her in the woods
kissin' him!"</p>

<p>White with rage, not for himself, but
that the dear name of his Lady should
be soiled by their lips, Tony raised his
slender arm to strike. "Say what you
please to me," he muttered between his
clenched teeth, "but if you dare to even
<i>speak</i> of her, I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tony said no more, for one of the men
half crazed with liquor, lifted the bicycle
suddenly, and with a single blow across
the curve between his shoulders, dashed
him heavily to the ground. Thoroughly
frightened, the crowd dispersed leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Tony in the dusty road, amid the wreck
of his wheel.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the doctor had arrived with
Miss Atherton's servant. In half an hour
the invalid was resting quietly, and as
the doctor took his leave, Miss Atherton
told him how she had sent Tony after him
on his bicycle only a few minutes before
he arrived.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't have done that," he
said. "There's a rough crowd of men in
the town, and they are very likely to harm
the little chap if they have half a chance.
I'll look for him as I go home and have him
come and tell you that he is safe."</p>

<p>Not a man was in sight when the doctor
found Tony, and even the shades of the
store windows were closely drawn.</p>

<p>After vainly knocking at the door, he
smashed in the window with a strong
stick, and entering, found the men who were
wont to loaf in front of the store, huddled
in a corner of it. With the voice of one
accustomed to command, he made them
improvise a stretcher under his directions,
and three of them helped him carry Tony
home.</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head gravely
when questioned as to the extent of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
injury. "Some one must stay with him
to-night," he said.</p>

<p>One of the men volunteered, but a look
of such helpless terror came into Tony's
eyes, that he sent them all away, telling
the last one to go for Miss Atherton.</p>

<p>It was from him that she learned the
whole story and fairly trembling with indignation,
turned upon him.</p>

<p>"There isn't one of you in this whole
village worthy to touch even the hand of
the boy you have killed to-day. He was
a man&mdash;you are nothing but brutes.
Now go, and never let me see your face
again."</p>

<p>The doctor met her at the door of Tony's
little house. "You'd better stay with
him," he said in a low tone. "He can't
last until morning, and your brother will
be perfectly safe with the nurse. I'll go
up to your house and send down anything
you may need. My man will come and
stay within call."</p>

<p>Miss Atherton gave him a note to the
nurse, and then went in to Tony. His
eyes brightened at the sight of her, and he
tried to speak.</p>

<p>"Hush, dear," she said, "it's all right.
The doctor came just after you left, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
my brother is in no danger now. I've
come to stay with you."</p>

<p>Her cool hand brushed back the hair
from his forehead, and moved by an
impulse of womanly pity, she knelt beside
him and laid her cheek against his own.
He closed his eyes and seemed to sleep.</p>

<p>Her eyes wandered around the little
room. A table stood in the corner of it.
A cabinet photograph of herself in a pasteboard
frame, around which Tony had
painted a wreath of pond-lilies, stood in
the centre of it beside a cracked cup filled
with early autumn flowers. The flute lay
straight across the front, like a votive
offering, and underneath the photograph
was written in his large, unformed hand:
"My Guenevere."</p>

<p>At last she understood, and feeling that
his little shrine was too holy for even her
eyes to see, she turned them away.</p>

<p>Tony stirred, and she slipped her arm
under his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Miss Atherton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"Did&mdash;did&mdash;they&mdash;tell you&mdash;what they
said?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear." Her eyes filled.</p>

<p>"I didn't mind&mdash;for myself&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hush, dear; I know."</p>

<p>Feeling herself unworthy in the presence
of a true knightly soul, Miss Atherton
held him untiringly in her arms. When
he cried out with pain, she drew him close
to her, and pillowed his head upon her
breast. "Am&mdash;I&mdash;going to&mdash;die&mdash;Miss
Atherton?"</p>

<p>She could hardly whisper the words:
"I am afraid so, Tony."</p>

<p>"Will you&mdash;stay&mdash;until&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;afterward&mdash;you won't let&mdash;them&mdash;touch
me?"</p>

<p>"No, Tony, no."</p>

<p>His eyes followed hers as she looked at
the little shrine again.</p>

<p>"Do you mind?" he whispered anxiously.
"I thought&mdash;you wouldn't know&mdash;if I
called&mdash;you&mdash;Guenevere&mdash;at home."</p>

<p>"Tony, dear, no queen ever had a braver,
truer knight than you have been to me.
Even Launcelot was not half so noble
in the service of Guenevere, as you have
been in mine."</p>

<p>He smiled happily and seemed to sleep
again.</p>

<p>Just at dawn, he said weakly: "Miss
Atherton?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it, Tony?"</p>

<p>"The lilies&mdash;are opening&mdash;about now,&mdash;ar'n't
they?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder. Is there anything
you want?"</p>

<p>"Would&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;kiss me&mdash;just&mdash;once?
I used&mdash;to dream&mdash;you did&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a sob she could not hide, she drew
him close. He sighed contentedly as he
put his frail arms around her, like a weary
child, and with his Guenevere's kisses
on his lips and brow, her little Launcelot
blossomed into the light of which she
had told him.</p>

<h2>Her Volunteer</h2>


<p>The flags fluttered listlessly in the warm
spring air, and the little group on Jean
Perry's piazza was scarcely more energetic.
There was a martial significance in the
atmosphere, for the heavy tread of battalions
reverberated in the hearts of those
who had seen one war, and came forth with
sudden force to those who were about to
live through it for the first time. Yet, the
few who lounged in hammocks spoke in
depreciation.</p>

<p>"The regular army is enough," said one;
"that's what those fellows are for. As
for me, I'm not anxious to be shot at.
I would rather be excused."</p>

<p>Two or three of the others agreed, but
Jack Terrence was watching Jean with
grave trouble in his face. At the first
sneering comment her eyes had flashed
and then filled; now her breast was heaving
with excitement, and her sensitive mouth
was quivering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>A passing breeze stirred the scarlet
veined folds of the flag above her, and for
a moment it seemed to wave in proud
defiance. But even as the century of its
glorious history came back to her, one of
the men looking at it reminiscently, was
moved to languid speech.</p>

<p>"Funny thing, that rag up there&mdash;I
suppose it really means a great deal to
some people!"</p>

<p>"Do you honestly think so?" Jean's
voice carried a note of fearful scorn. "I
am proud to say that I am one of the people
to whom it means something&mdash;more than
your little mind can comprehend. If I
could die fighting for it, and have it
wrapped round me at the last, it would be
glory enough for one small life, but I'm
only a miserable woman, and I have to
stay at home. Why ar'n't you in the
ranks, fighting like a man? What do you
think would become of your country if
all the men were like you?" She ended
convincingly.</p>

<p>The astonished individual whom she
addressed made the earliest exit compatible
with his dignity. The girls followed by
twos and threes, and at last the time came
to which Terrence had looked forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
for an hour&mdash;a solitary moment with
Jean.</p>

<p>"Let's go down to the river," he said,
after waiting for her to speak. He took
possession of her in the calm, masterful
way that rests and soothes a nervous
woman, and as his ring on her finger gave
him the right to do. He found her hat
and put it on her unresisting head without
jabbing her with the pins, for which, even
in her excitement, she was dimly grateful.</p>

<p>"You're such a comfort, Jack," she
sighed restfully, as they strolled in the
afternoon sunshine to the bank of the
little noisy stream, that by courtesy was
called a river.</p>

<p>"I get tired and fretted, and when you
come it's just like putting on a pair of old
shoes after you've been wearing new
ones."</p>

<p>Terrence laughed. He was used to
Jean's queer similes, and loved her all
the more for her unexpectedness.</p>

<p>"You take things too seriously, dear,
but just the same I was very proud of you
this afternoon. You scattered the enemy's
forces neatly." He laughed again, but
this time there was no mirth in his face.
"I was glad, too, Jean, because it makes it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
easier to speak of something I've been
thinking about for the last two weeks."</p>

<p>For an instant her heart stood still.
She did not need to be told what had made
him unlike his sunny self for the past few
days. He turned his face away that he
might not see the trouble in hers. She
began to understand.</p>

<p>After a little he spoke again. "Dear
little woman," he said softly, "it all rests
with you. It is for you to decide&mdash;not me.
If you feel that my first duty is to you,
you have only to say the word; if you feel
that, dearly as I love you, there is something
beyond that, you&mdash;you need not
speak at all."</p>

<p>They were sitting on the bank of the
stream now, and the late afternoon light
was playing upon its rippling surface,
while a glory of crimson and gold touched
each rock and tree.</p>

<p>Half-way up the hill beyond, was a tiny
two-story house in process of construction.
On the crest, where the sun might
shine on it longest, the flag seemed
beckoning to them both. They felt its
meaning.</p>

<p>"Jean," said Jack again, and his lips
trembled as they said the little name,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
"is the roof of our home coming between
us and our flag?"</p>

<p>"If it did," she answered slowly, "it
could only be a house&mdash;not a home."</p>

<p>In those few moments she had fought a
gallant battle with herself. She was white
now, but there was new strength in her
voice.</p>

<p>"Brave heart," said Terrence tenderly,
"I knew what you would say!"</p>

<p>Then he went on to tell her of the regiment
that was forming, and in which he
had been offered a position in the line
of promotion.</p>

<p>Something of the old fire came into her
eyes. "Never mind position or promotion.
Put on the private's uniform and fight in
the ranks and be glad you've got the health
and the strength and the right to do it.
Though," she added, as an afterthought,
"I'd try to be reconciled to it, even if you
were a major-general." She smiled slyly.</p>

<p>There was no one to see him put his
arm around her in the twilight and draw
her close. The soft melody of the little
stream, as it hurried noisily away, and
the drowsy chirp of the birds came dreamily
into the summer stillness. Up on the
hill, like a parting benediction, a soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
sunset glow trembled and shone around
the flag.</p>

<p>"My sweetheart," he said, "I want to
tell you something for you to remember
for all time." A lump came into his
throat, but he choked it down and went
on. "It sounds like a joke in a comic
paper for me to say you're the only woman
I ever loved; but it's true, and you know
it is, and it's the kind of love that couldn't
die with the body of either of us, don't
you know that, dear?"</p>

<p>A sob from Jean made him draw her
closer still. "So I want to tell you now
that, whatever happens, that will always
be the same&mdash;nothing can ever change that.
I want you to remember that. I haven't
half deserved the love you've given me,
but it's the sweetest thing God ever let
a man dream of, and it's made me a better
man, Jean, and there won't be a moment
while I'm away that I won't see your dear
face, because I'm fighting for you as well
as for my dear country&mdash;to be the man
you want me to be, and to make you proud
of your volunteer."</p>

<p>The succeeding days were all confusion
and preparation. To Terrence, they were
days of drill, recruiting and unaccustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
labour; to Jean they were days of heartache,
mingled with a strange pride that
was neither wholly happiness nor wholly
pain.</p>

<p>The day came at last when the regiment
was ordered forward, and the whole town
turned out to give its boys a rousing farewell.
The love of fight, mingled with the
stern discipline and cool courage of the
Anglo-Saxon, was in the face of every
man in the regiment.</p>

<p>Jean never forgot the spectacle as they
formed in marching ranks. In spite of
the pain at her heart, she was unreasonably
proud at the sight of Jack in his new
uniform&mdash;not that of a private, as she had
wished him to go, but as first lieutenant,
looking very handsome.</p>

<p>The long column swung into line.
Quick and short came the word of command.
Her eyes were upon her volunteer,
and across the crowd of waiting thousands,
he saw only her&mdash;cheeks crimson with
pride, eyes sweet with love, and lips that
trembled and tried to be brave in spite of
all.</p>

<p>"Forward, march!" It was the summons
to the glory and the agony of battle
for those who kept time with the music.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
It was the summons to as brave a faith
to those who remained behind.</p>

<p>After the first shock was over, Jean
became almost happy. Jack wrote letters
full of hope and good spirits. Every
amusing thing that happened in camp,
he stored away to write to Jean. He even
had a little note-book in which to jot down,
from time to time, things which would
interest her. This was a never failing
source of pleasure to his mates, and he
was enthusiastically "guyed" by every
man in the company. Of course he told
her this, and, womanlike, Jean was much
pleased.</p>

<p>Boxes of home delicacies sent to Jack
filled the entire company with a beautiful
admiration for "Terrence's girl." Magazines,
papers and letters almost flooded
the mails.</p>

<p>"Poor Terrence is getting pale," said
one of them at mess.</p>

<p>"Separation," suggested the corporal.</p>

<p>"Naw," rejoined the other. "It's
carryin' his mail from the post-office to
his tent. That's what's wearin' on him."</p>

<p>Like a happy lover, Terrence took the
jokes cheerfully. The routine of camp
life made some of the men complain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
bitterly, but he said never a word. It
was for his country&mdash;and Jean.</p>

<p>After two months of waiting, the regiment
was ordered to the front and the
old confusion began again. The night in
camp was a memorable one. Already the
star-spangled flag had been planted in
new places, and the thirst for conquest,
which is perhaps, more Anglo-Saxon than
exclusively British, was upon every man
in the army.</p>

<p>There is no need to write of the gallant
charge at Santiago; no need to speak of
the steadfast courage of those who faced
three times their number in the narrow
pass; no need to say that every lad in
Uncle Sam's uniform proved himself to
be the stuff of which Republics are built&mdash;for
the world knows it all. Whatever
criticism the strategists of the future,
sitting in comfortable chairs, may make,
as to tactics and military skill, the valour
of the American army has been proved
anew.</p>

<p>Up the burning, blazing heights, Lieutenant
Terrence rushed with his men,
stopping not for strange pitfalls and unknown
dangers, facing volley after volley
of explosive bullets, heeding not those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
fell by the way, as long as through the
smoke of battle, dimly lit by flash and
flame, the flag called&mdash;"Follow!"</p>

<p>The orders had been brief: "Take
the blockhouse on the height by storm."
And the charge began with a cheer. But
only twenty-two of the seventy-five men
reached the summit, and after a fierce
hand-to-hand conflict, dislodged the superior
force. The rest lay upon the hillside,&mdash;some
past help, and all exposed to
the fire of an unchivalrous foe.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Terrence was among those
reported "missing." The corporal spent
the night in the underbrush with a lantern,
but to no avail.</p>

<p>"Don't be so cut up, Johnny," said a
messmate, "you can't do him no good."</p>

<p>"Maybe he fell off the side," replied
the corporal, after a long silence, "and,
anyway, it's his girl I'm thinking of. I'm
going to find him for her."</p>

<p>Over the wire from headquarters came
the list of killed, wounded and missing.
Jean grasped the morning paper eagerly
and then grew white "Missing! Missing!"</p>

<p>A dull dead weight settled down upon
her like a suffocating pall. With sudden
meaning, what he had said came back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
her: "It's you I'm fighting for as well
as for my country&mdash;to be the man you
want me to be, and to make you proud of
your volunteer."</p>

<p>The strained nerves and tortured heart
could bear no more, and she was mercifully
unconscious when they found her lying
with the paper in her hands.</p>

<p>There were hushed whispers in the house
for days to come, and the wires were kept
busy with eager questionings. The old
family physician was fighting an unequal
battle with death for Jean had no desire
to live.</p>

<p>After a week, a telegram came for Jean.
It was the old doctor who opened it with
trembling hands, dreading to give her the
message he knew it must contain. After
the first eager glance, his face changed
mysteriously, and then became transfigured
with a radiant smile as he read:</p>

<p>"Wounded, but not seriously. Home
on <i>Olivette</i>. Terrence."</p>

<p>The little blind god has a healing power
quite beyond prosaic belief and in a very
short time Jean was able to go out and
once more the sound of building came from
the hillside. All through the days that
followed she listened to it with joy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Every ring of metal or shout of command
was a distinct pleasure.</p>

<p>It was evening when Terrence reached
the town unannounced and unheralded
with his right arm in a sling. Those on
the piazza merely knew that some one
had entered the gate, but a white-robed
figure flew down the steps with a cry of
gladness that sent the family into the
house.</p>

<p>Human hearts did not need to be told
that a bronzed and bearded soldier was
holding his sweetheart close, and that a
woman was sobbing out more happiness
than one heart could hold, on the shoulder
of her volunteer.</p>

<h2>In Reflected Glory</h2>


<p>Wheels! Wheels! Wheels! The
boulevards were full of them, from
the glistening up-to-date mount, back to
the antiquated '91 model with its hard
tires and widely curved handle-bars.</p>

<p>The sun struck the sheen of nickel and
new enamel and sent a thousand little
needles of light in all directions. Even
the '91 model was beautiful in the light
of the spring day, overtaken though it
might be by the swiftly moving procession.</p>

<p>Wheels! Every man, woman, and child
in the city of Chicago who could beg,
borrow, or rent a bicycle, was speeding
westward to the flagstaff at the entrance
to the Garfield Park Loop. Every spoke
and bar had been polished to the limit,
and the long asphalt boulevard was a
glittering, sparkling avenue of wheels.</p>

<p>Wheels! It was the day of the great
road race, under the auspices of the Associated
Cycling Clubs. The twenty-five mile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
course had been smoothed and measured,
the sky was blue and cloudless, and far
away in Wheeling four hundred eager
cyclers awaited the bugle call.</p>

<p>John Gardner stood at the door of his
news-room and watched with a wistful
eye, the few hundred wheelmen who had
chosen to ride on the business street that
went past his door. The orange and black
of the South Shore Club fluttered from
many a shining bar, and at the sight of the
colours the old man's face grew tender.
For it was Jack's club that boasted the
orange and black&mdash;Jack Gardner of the
"Varsity, '98," and his only son. A touch
on his arm made him turn his face
within.</p>

<p>"Father," said a gentle voice, "why
don't we go to the doin's?"</p>

<p>"Land sakes, Mother, who'd take care
of the store?"</p>

<p>"Guess the store ain't goin' to run away,
and we ain't been out in years. Let's go,
Father, and see Jack ride!"</p>

<p>It was John Gardner's way to oppose
everything at first, and then to generously
give in. He liked to feel himself master
in his own house, so he hesitated.</p>

<p>But the stronger will was fully settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
upon going. "I'm a-goin' Father, even
if I have to go alone."</p>

<p>She vanished into the back part of the
store and began to brush carefully the
state gown, the brown silk, made after
the quaint fashion of a bygone day. After
a few minutes the old man appeared in the
door.</p>

<p>"I reckon we'll go, Hannah," he said,
with the air of one granting a favour, "but
it do seem wrong to leave the little store!"</p>

<p>For many a year the little store had
been open on all holidays, as well as weekdays
and evenings, for Jack in school and
college had needed money, and a startling
amount of it. Old John Gardner never complained.
Hampered, and made ashamed
all his life by his lack of "book larnin',"
he had vowed that his son should have "a
bang-up eddication, the best they is a-goin',"
if he could get it for him.</p>

<p>To-day Jack was to ride in the road
race, and imbued with solemn importance
Gardner, senior, robed himself for the
occasion. They made a queer picture as
they stood on the corner waiting for a car.
Hannah's brown silk was wrinkled and
shabby, but her thin gray hair arranged
in tiny puffs around her forehead, looked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
as her fond mate said, "right smart."
Twenty years ago, when Jack was a little
boy in dresses, his father had bought a
silk hat to wear to a funeral, and it was
this relic of past splendour which now
adorned his head.</p>

<p>Once on the car, a new fear presented
itself. "Mother," he said, "sposen Jack
should see us!"</p>

<p>For an instant her heart stood still.
"He won't," she said bravely; "he won't
see anything but that new bicycle of his'n
and we will come home as soon as it's
over."</p>

<p>"I don't know's we'd ought," said the
old man doubtfully. "He might not like
it."</p>

<p>"Like what?" demanded Hannah
sharply.</p>

<p>"Our goin'!"</p>

<p>"Hush, Father," she answered, "you
know we don't see Jack very often 'cause
he has to live down where his school is.
Lemme see&mdash;it's three months now since
he's been home, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Three months yestidy."</p>

<p>"So what's goin' to hurt if we see him
ride to-day? He'll never notice us among
all them folks."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Two girls who sat opposite were watching
the old couple with very evident
amusement. "There's rural simplicity
for you," said one.</p>

<p>"So I see," responded the other. "They
appear to be attached to some Jack.
Wouldn't it be funny if it were Jack
Gardner?" They laughed in unison and
Hannah looked up into their faces. John's
eyes followed hers and neither spoke
for a moment. They saw nothing but
the joy and happiness of girlhood and
something blinded them both. Jack was
forgotten for the moment in the memory
of the little girl who lay in the Silent City
beyond the smoke and dust of the town.</p>

<p>They left the car when the others did
and followed the crowd.</p>

<p>"I don't b'leeve Jack'll see us,
Mother," said the old man. "I ain't goin'
to worry about it no more."</p>

<p>Twenty-five miles away, Jack Gardner
surveyed his wheel complacently. Every
screw was tightened, his chains were just
right, his tires were exactly mellow enough
and his handle-bars were at the proper
pitch. He was none the less pleased with
his own appearance, for he had written
his father that he needed a new suit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
in the colours worn by the South Shore
Club. He had searched the town for
the orange and black and finally found them.
The S.S.C. on his black chest could be
seen as far as his wheel could, and he had
topped the glaring outfit with a flaming
orange cap, with a black tassel to stream
in the wind behind.</p>

<p>"Get on to the oriole!" The champion
of a rival club was inclined to be sportive
at Jack's expense. He retorted with a
fling at the green costume of the other,
and then the bugle sounded for the flying
start.</p>

<p>Anxious friends and trainers shouted,
final directions from behind the "dead
line," as Jack called it. Another blare
from the bugle, a sudden whir, a flash of
the shining spokes and they were off.</p>

<p>As the last group flew over the tape
the train started back to the city. A
South Shore Club man climbed up on
the locomotive to "josh" the engineer.
"You'll have to get a move on you, if
you catch Gardner," he said.</p>

<p>The engineer laughed and looked fondly
at his giant of steel. Perhaps an engineer
enamoured of his engine can understand
the love of a cyclist for his wheel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>The people around the Garfield Park
Loop were beginning to get impatient.
Most of them had stood for two hours
holding their bicycles, and even a well
behaved bicycle is an awkward possession
in a crowd. Pedals scraped the shins
of utterly strange riders, handle-bars got
tangled in watch-guards, and front wheels
got into mischief with unpleasant regularity.</p>

<p>Close to the course, and on the grassy
bank, sat Mr. and Mrs. Gardner. Kindly
souls had made way for them until they
had at last reached the very front. The
day and the multitude were almost
spectacle enough, but a cry from the far
north brought them to their feet.</p>

<p>Yes, there they were&mdash;a cloud of dust
across the field. How small the riders
seemed! Nearer and nearer they came&mdash;how
the shining wheels flew through the
sunlight! Tense, strained faces almost on
the handle-bars: every man of them was
doing his best, and the crowd was cheering
like mad. The band played merrily,
as on and on they flew,&mdash;past the judges'
stand, over the tape and down, to the
mingled praise and solicitude of their
friends. The old people were very much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
disappointed. Jack had not ridden after
all! Perhaps&mdash;but there was another
cloud of dust and another cry from the
north. On came another group of riders.
They went by like the whirlwind, but no
Jack was there.</p>

<p>"I sh'd have thought he'd got back
somewheres near the front," said the old
man. He was hurt to think his son was
so far behind.</p>

<p>Group after group passed by, the old
people watching anxiously; then Hannah
gripped his arm suddenly.</p>

<p>See! Down the course, only a faint
speck now, shone the orange and black
of the South Shore Club. Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Yes, riding at the head of thirty tired
wheelmen, to the stirring strains of a
Sousa march, their Jack, strong, superb,
excited, nerving himself for the final
effort.</p>

<p>Their hearts stopped beating during
the instant he was flying by. "There,"
she whispered reassuringly, "I told you
he wouldn't see us. My! Wasn't he
fine?"</p>

<p>But John Gardner could not speak, for
his eyes were dim with happy pride in
remembrance of that superb specimen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
perfect manhood six feet high&mdash;his Jack,
to whom he had given the "eddication."</p>

<p>They watched the rest of the race with
little interest, for the best of it all had gone
by.</p>

<p>When the last rider crossed the tape,
the multitude stirred to go. "We better
stand right here, Hannah, till some of these
folks gets away," he said. So they stood
perfectly still and let the crowd surge
around them.</p>

<p>Then a great huzza went up, the track
cleared again, as if by magic, and down
the course came a dozen men, shouting
in unrestrained joy. Aloft on their
shoulders they held&mdash;the old people craned
their necks to see&mdash;yes, Jack&mdash;their Jack&mdash;looking
sheepish and very much ashamed.</p>

<p>"Why, Mother," the old man cried,
"he's won! Our Jack's won the race!
Do you hear?"</p>

<p>Mother's eyes were fixed on the black
and orange sweater, for Jack was once
again in regulation bicycle attire, and her
heart was too full to trust itself for speech.</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Gardner! 'Rah for
the South Shore Club!" and the great
field swelled and swelled again with bursts
of applause. And then&mdash;the crowd parted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
some way and Jack saw those pathetic
faces upturned to him.</p>

<p>It is said that when a man is drowning,
in the flash of a second his whole previous
life passes in review. Something like this
came to him at the crowning moment of
his twenty-three years.</p>

<p>At that minute he knew, as never before,
how those hands had toiled for him, how
those lips had prayed for him, and how
those honest hearts had loved him ever
since he was born. A sudden lump came
into his throat, for he seemingly had
withheld the only reward they wanted for
it all.</p>

<p>"Let me down, fellows," he cried,
"there's my folks."</p>

<p>Almost before they knew what had
happened, he had rushed up to them
with hands outstretched. "Why, Father!
Mother!" he exclaimed; "why didn't
you let me know you wanted to come?"</p>

<p>Just a minute the old people doubted
the wisdom of their course, then the gladness
in Jack's face set all at rest. The
men from the South Shore Club gathered
around and were presented, one by one.
They shook hands with the old gentleman
and told them how proud they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
of Jack, and doffed their caps to Mrs.
Gardner, "just z's if I was a fine lady,"
she said afterward.</p>

<p>Then Jack said everybody was going
down to the club for lunch and his father
and mother must come too.</p>

<p>"No, no!" gasped Mrs. Gardner in
affright; "no! no!"</p>

<p>"Well, indeed you are coming," said
Jack, with a charming air of proprietorship.
"I guess when a fellow wins the race of
the year that his father and mother will
go to lunch with him." Then he squeezed
her thin wrinkled hand and whispered
tenderly: "Dear little mother! To think
you wanted to come, and I didn't know!"</p>

<p>The hero of the day turned to those
who were with him: "Will some of you
fellows get a carriage? I don't think I
want any more bicycle riding to-day and
I'll go down with my father and mother
if one of you boys will lead my wheel."</p>

<p>It was an enchanted journey for the
old people to roll down the broad smooth
boulevard in a real carriage, with Jack
sitting in front of them telling them all
about the race. The President of the
South Shore Club, the son of a man known
and honoured throughout Chicago, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
asked to be presented, and said he hoped
Jack's father would be willing to be his
guest for the day.</p>

<p>"I told him father would be pleased,"
concluded Jack, "and he wanted mother
too, but I said I guessed not, that I was
going to have my little mother for my own
guest."</p>

<p>At last, when the carriage stopped
before an imposing brown stone house,
Jack helped them out, and entered the
club with the shabby little brown figure
on his arm. "Just wait here a few
minutes," he said, "until I make myself
presentable."</p>

<p>He stationed them on a luxurious sofa,
and ran off to the dressing-rooms.</p>

<p>The old man looked after him fondly.
"I didn't think Jack would be ashamed of
us, Mother," he said.</p>

<p>"No, Father, and he ain't."</p>

<p>"My, ain't this a grand place?"</p>

<p>Half awed, they gazed at the rich
furnishings in silence. "Seems like heaven
don't it?" he murmured.</p>

<p>"Makes me think more of the chapter
in Solomon," she replied.</p>

<p>"How's that, Mother?"</p>

<p>The little old lady looked up at him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
her face shining with ineffable happiness,
and repeated softly:</p>

<p>"'<i>He led me into his banqueting house,
and his banner over me was love.</i>'"</p>

<h2>The House Beautiful</h2>


<p>Four years at College had given Jack
Hardy high ambitions, but two years
in society had perceptibly lowered them.
Jack had inherited enough money to make
him a prize in the matrimonial lottery
and he was not slow to see that the reason
of it lay in his bank account. With a
singular lack of conceit, he did not admit,
even to himself, his personal charms.</p>

<p>Walking home one evening from a large
reception, his indignation rapidly developed
into a moving force, and in a sudden flash
of insight he saw two paths which lay
straight before him.</p>

<p>One was smooth, leading to gardens of
pleasure; the other rough, toilsome, and
strewn with failures, but at the end of it
was a goal well worth working for. His
inheritance was all he needed to enter one;
but on the other hand, hard, unfaltering
work lay before him and was the only
way to success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>His strong young face was set in lines
of unwonted determination. "Farewell
to an idle society life," he said aloud,
"here's to hard work, self-respect, and
perhaps an honourable name."</p>

<p>There was not a little comment in his
set when it became known that Hardy
had left town without assigning any
reasons, length of stay, or even leaving an
address.</p>

<p>He retired to an obscure hamlet on the
Jersey coast and secured a room in a
rambling old house which faced the sea.
Here he could work; he could study hard,
or write, and become, perhaps, a strong
man intellectually, instead of being a
fastidious ornament in a drawing-room
where he felt his financial value was the
key-note to his popularity.</p>

<p>The white-haired mistress of the mansion,
however, had a confession to make
which did not agree at all with his inclinations.</p>

<p>"I've got another boarder," she said,
"but she's a quiet, nice-appearing girl
and I guess she won't disturb you
any."</p>

<p>"Girl!" Hardy scowled, then recovered
himself. "Please, don't take any more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
boarders," he said smilingly, "I'll make it
worth your while."</p>

<p>When he said "please" women instinctively
obeyed him. Mrs. Kitson readily
promised to abstain from further extension
of the hilarious pastime of taking boarders,
which she had hitherto found to be necessary
to her pocket-book, if not to her
inclinations.</p>

<p>He spent the afternoon in getting his
traps settled in his new location. The
quiet was broken only by the boom of the
breakers on the shore below, and the room
was guiltless of sofa pillows and photograph
frames with which women are wont
to burden a helpless bachelor. He felt
a certain sense of emancipation.</p>

<p>It was rather awkward having a girl
around, and he contemplated the propriety
of bribing Mrs. Kitson to invent some
excuse for dispensing with her presence.
Some country damsel, he reflected, perhaps
a seamstress, or a teacher who "boarded
round." He determined to treat her with
cool politeness while he might be forced
to endure her proximity.</p>

<p>Going down to supper he encountered
the other boarder in the sitting-room.
His hostess, rather uncertain as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
proper form of introduction, mumbled
something he did not quite understand.
He did not wish to appear at all concerned
anyway, and bowed distantly.</p>

<p>Miss Wheeler's dark eyes flashed and
the colour came into her face. He noted
the signs of resentment and wondered
what he had done; not that he cared,
particularly, only one should always be
polite.</p>

<p>The supper was delicious. Everything
was well cooked and well served. The
china was dainty and the linen spotless.</p>

<p>Under the kindly influence of food
which proverbially melts the masculine
heart, Hardy began to look occasionally,
and with some curiosity at the girl opposite
him. She was tall, and well formed, her
head well poised, and her voice, when she
spoke, was agreeably modulated. She
must be the teacher who "boarded round."</p>

<p>She was apparently unconscious of his
presence. She drew Mrs. Kitson into
volumes of personal reminiscence which
prevented any awkward silence, and when
they had finished, went with the hostess
into the kitchen and helped her wash
the dishes.</p>

<p>Hardy stood aloof for a moment, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
then went up-stairs. He was accustomed
to having girls all smiles and attention
when he graciously consented to appear.
This one, however, could not have been
more politely unconcerned if he had been
a door-mat!</p>

<p>"She doesn't know," he began unconsciously,
as the dull red flooded his face.
"No, and she never shall!"</p>

<p>With that desire for achievement which
pique inspires, he went to work. He had
a dim notion of writing a story, such as
he used to do for a college paper, but
it eventually became a short sketch, half
humorous and half cynical in tone.</p>

<p>When it was finished, he went out to
send it off. He knew the street number
of only one publication&mdash;a thing he had
bought on the way down to appease the
business instincts of the energetic and
persistent train boy.</p>

<p>When he returned, he glanced through
the window of the sitting-room as he
stepped upon the broad, old-fashioned
veranda. There was no light except the
driftwood fire in the big fireplace, and
Miss Wheeler sat in a low chair watching
it. It was an earnest womanly face
full of purpose and aspiration. The repressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
energy, which he had first noticed
in her manner, was gone. She was off
her guard, and her eyes were those of a
wistful child, softened and made tender
by her dreaming.</p>

<p>When he went down to breakfast the
next morning, he learned that Miss Wheeler
had taken her bicycle and gone off to
spend the day. With a little tact, he
diverted Mrs. Kitson's conversation to
herself. He did not wish to take an unfair
advantage, and besides he was not at
all interested.</p>

<p>It was a long day, for he did not feel
like work, so he tramped through the fields,
sat on the sea shore, read a little, envied
the consolation other men seemed to find
in smoking, and was conscious of a new
interest in life, when, just at dusk, Miss
Wheeler rode up and dismounted at the
gate.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kitson's penetrating voice rang
out clearly, and rose to his room. "How
fur did you ride?"</p>

<p>Miss Wheeler was bending over her
cyclometer, but her reply was inaudible.</p>

<p>"Hey?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-three miles." Her young
voice was clear and strong this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>At supper he watched her closely for
symptoms of weariness, but she was fresh
and rosy, and unaffectedly hungry. She
still wore her bicycle suit, and talked
pleasantly with Mrs. Kitson. She answered
Hardy's questions, to be sure, but
it was in monosyllables.</p>

<p>"She must have the strength of an
Amazon," he mused, as he sat by the
fire while she was helping Mrs. Kitson
with the dishes, and laughing occasionally
in a happy childlike way.</p>

<p>A ten-mile ride would utterly exhaust
any girl he knew, and she apparently
considered twice that distance merely a
pleasant outing!</p>

<p>She came in after a while and sat on
the other side of the hearth. Mrs. Kitson
with many apologies, had gone "visitin'."</p>

<p>After an awkward silence he laughed
outright&mdash;the boyish hearty laugh that won
him friends everywhere.</p>

<p>"Are you going to keep it all to yourself?"
she asked smiling.</p>

<p>"I was thinking," he returned, "of
what the Autocrat said when some one
asked him to define happiness."</p>

<p>She dimpled prettily.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. 'Four feet on a fender.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>Hers were not so far away but that the
contrast in size was evident.</p>

<p>The ice was broken. "And are you
happy?" he inquired tentatively.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I be?" she answered.
"I've got a sound body, a clear brain,
an honest name and a clean heart. Isn't
that enough?" She looked up smiling.</p>

<p>He hesitated, for her point of view was
new to him. "Most people would include
money in the list, I've got all the things
you say make you happy, and yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You haven't the money." She had
finished his sentence for him.</p>

<p>"You don't look as if it bothered you
a great deal," she added shyly.</p>

<p>He was silent. For once he had been
separated from his birthright and considered
apart from his inheritance. The
sensation was distinctly novel. "Do you
ever think," she went on, "of the house
you would build if you had all the money
you wanted?"</p>

<p>"I used to, when I was a very little boy,"
he answered with an effort.</p>

<p>"I do even now, it's one of my daydreams
and I call it my House Beautiful,"
she said.</p>

<p>He asked a timid question and something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
of the expression he had seen on her
face in the firelight the evening before,
returned to it. Had she been dreaming of
her "House Beautiful" then?</p>

<p>The mellow tones of her voice sounded
full and soft in his ears. She was telling
of a house of grey stone with wide porches
and massive columns. She spoke of the
reception hall, the stately stairway, and
the tiger skin rug in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>A tower room with windows facing
both the sunset and the sea, beautiful
things in costly woods, and fabrics in
white and gold.</p>

<p>He was interested, in spite of himself,
and began to help her plan it. There
was no difference of opinion, even in the
smallest detail, and room by room, and
floor by floor, they furnished their imaginary
castle. On the very top of the tower,
the Stars and Stripes would always flutter&mdash;"because
it's the most beautiful flag
in the world," with a little choke in her
voice, "and it means the most."</p>

<p>Only a week before he had attended that
offensive reception, and he was thinking
of the contrast now. The men that
night had spoken with an affected English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
drawl, and the girls were all "going
abroad for the summer."</p>

<p>And to-night he had forgotten his bank
and mining stocks, and was sitting by a
driftwood fire with a girl who had childish
dreams of building a house, and choked
when she spoke of the flag.</p>

<p>"And the doors should open forever,
and ever, to all who had done anything
noble in the world, or had tried to do it."</p>

<p>With a little lingering sigh, she stretched
her white hands towards the flames. The
House Beautiful was finished, but she
was still dreaming.</p>

<p>He repeated her thought mentally:
"The doors should be open forever, and
ever, to all who had done anything noble
in the world, or had <i>tried</i> to do it." Would
that bar him out? He turned uneasily
in his chair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kitson returned, and he felt that
he must say something: "You should
have gone to college," he ventured, in a
tone which was meant to be both fatherly
and cheerful.</p>

<p>She rose smilingly and bade him good
night. "I am a graduate of Vassar,"
she said simply.</p>

<p>A day or two later his heart fluttered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
gladly when the mail brought him a check
for his sketch, and a request to submit
further manuscript.</p>

<p>He shut himself up in his room for a
whole day and tried to work, but a far-away
clack-clack grated on his nerves
and made him irritable. He went off
for a tramp and on his return found Miss
Wheeler sitting on the porch.</p>

<p>"Did you hear that constant clatter
this afternoon?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was my typewriter," she
answered demurely. She was evidently
a stenographer.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Hardy awkwardly,
"but it disturbs me." Then with more
innocent joy than foolish pride, he continued:</p>

<p>"I&mdash;ah&mdash;write, you know."</p>

<p>Miss Wheeler gathered up her books.
"I regret that it annoys you," she said
frigidly, "but I cannot help it." Then
with an exact imitation of his tone and
manner, she added: "I&mdash;ah&mdash;write, you
know." And then she left him alone.</p>

<p>Hardy had business in town of such a
pressing nature that he could not even stop
to tell Mrs. Kitson that he was going.
He sent her a telegram from the station,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
saying he did not know when he would be
able to return.</p>

<p>The gay streets of the city, brilliantly
lighted, even in the early evening, were
full of allurement, as they always are,
to one who has been away. But a higher
impulse within him was striving with the
one that demanded pleasure. He would
go back. So he bought some magazines,
and sat down to wait for the outgoing
train, the very next day.</p>

<p>He cut the leaves mechanically, and
dipped here and there into the pages.
Then the title of a story caught his attention,
and he read it to the finish. It was
a simple tale, told with no striving after
effect, but the lines were broadly human,
and it rang true. The signature was
"Constance Wheeler."</p>

<p>The consciousness of his own caddishness
came home to him like a blow.</p>

<p>They had a long talk the next day, and
he told her what he was trying to do.
"But you discourage me," he said. "I
never can do it as you do."</p>

<p>They were sitting by the sea, watching
the sunset as the rich colours came over
from the west, and touched the waves
with tints of opal. "I've been doing it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
three or four years," she said, "and you
are just beginning." Then with unknowing
comprehension she went on. "Besides,
what one accomplishes, doesn't matter in
the least. It's the work that makes men
and women of us."</p>

<p>The light which was reflected back from
the surf made her face tender then, and
leaning forward, with a simple reverence
which she could not misunderstand, he
kissed her hand.</p>

<p>The summer promised to be all too
short. They studied and read together
and criticised each other's work.</p>

<p>Hardy was fond of rowing, so they
spent many hours together on the water.
Constance sat on a cushion in the stern
and read aloud, while Jack pulled vigorously
or let the boat drift idly, as best
suited his mood.</p>

<p>One day the book was absorbingly
interesting, and one of the oars slipped into
the softly-lapping water, and set out for
lands unknown. Constance saw it first
and her face changed. His eyes followed
hers, but he sat quite still for a moment.</p>

<p>They were but a mile from shore and the
tide was going in.</p>

<p>"We'll go in with it," she said bravely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>With the remaining oar Hardy turned
the boat so as to catch the full force of the
shoreward impulse, but in a very few
minutes they saw the tide would not do
as they wished.</p>

<p>A sudden cloud obscured the sun. The
wind shifted and grew cold. Quick to act
in an emergency, Jack took off his coat
and shoes and tied the anchor rope under
his arms. In an instant she saw what he
was going to do.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no, Jack," she pleaded.</p>

<p>It was the first time she had ever called
him Jack. The sky was threatening and
the wind was growing stronger.</p>

<p>"Constance, dearest," he said tenderly,
"there is no other way."</p>

<p>He sprang into the water and struck
out with long powerful strokes for the
shore.</p>

<p>As if conscious of its precious burden,
the boat followed slowly and steadily,
then more slowly, then in fitful jerks.
They were half-way to the shore but Jack's
strength was failing fast.</p>

<p>The sky grew darker, and there was a
sullen roar of thunder. Constance knelt
in the stern, took off her dress and shoes,
and took down her hair. She slipped into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the water just as the storm broke, and Jack
was gasping when she swam up beside him.</p>

<p>"It's a cramp," he said weakly.</p>

<p>"I know. Can you slip the rope over
your head?" She held him up while he
obeyed. The sea was rising and she felt
her strength to the full.</p>

<p>The boat drifted away and still holding
him up she put the braids of her hair into
his hands. As a drowning man will catch
at a straw, he clutched it, then sank almost
into unconsciousness, but still held with
spasmodic grasp to the only hope within
his hands.</p>

<p>It was too dark now to see the shore,
but Constance struggled on, keeping his
head above the water as best she could.
She rested from time to time by floating
and spending only strength enough to keep
them from being carried out to sea, but
she was rapidly becoming exhausted.</p>

<p>At last, when she was too weak to swim
another stroke, she sank despairingly,
and found the firm ground under her feet.
It was easy then, and she half dragged him
ashore.</p>

<p>When she awoke out of what seemed a
horrible dream, she was in her own room,
and Mrs. Kitson was bustling about her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
with motherly solicitude. Jack was kneeling
beside her, and when she opened her
eyes, his were shining with the "light
that was never on land or sea," as he took
her hand.</p>

<p>An answering glow crept into her face
and he stooped, unafraid, to her lips.
There was no need of words between them&mdash;love
went to meet love with open arms.</p>

<p>As soon as she was able to sit up, they
made plans for their future. "Just our
two pens, Jack," she said happily, "to
buy everything we want. But we won't
want much else, if we have each other."
A lump rose in his throat, but it was not
yet time to tell her.</p>

<p>He went to the city every day now, "on
business," as he said, and as the summer
faded, and the leaves turned crimson and
gold, Constance began her wedding gown.
She put so many hopes and fancies into
it with the tiny careful stitches she took
that had the white not been senseless, it
must have turned to rose under her hands.</p>

<p>They were married in a little church
on a glorious autumn day.</p>

<p>"I think it's the last day," she said;
"the summer only just waited for us."</p>

<p>He would not tell her where the wedding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
journey was to be, and she showed little
curiosity.</p>

<p>"I don't care where we go," she said
as they left the house for the last time,
"only you mustn't be extravagant."</p>

<p>It was not until the train stopped at
a little town by the sea, and very near the
city, that he gave her any hint of his
plans. They had taken a carriage and
driven down a beautiful winding road.
He waved his hand towards a distant hill.</p>

<p>"That is where we are going," he said.
"It's rather a pretty place," indifferently.
"I think you'll like it."</p>

<p>She saw a stately mansion of grey
stone, with wide porches and massive
tower, and where he knew the reception
hall and the stately stairway were just
as she would wish her own house to be&mdash;even
the tiger skin rug in the drawing-room,
and the beautiful things in costly
woods, and fabrics of white and gold.
He could stand it no longer and leaned
towards her, thrilling with an unspeakable
tenderness.</p>

<p>"Heart of mine," he whispered, "haven't
you guessed it?"</p>

<h2>From a Human Standpoint</h2>


<p>"Will the madam please walk in to
supper?"</p>

<p>Carroll stood in the doorway with a
napkin over his arm, the very picture of
servile obedience. Katherine sprang from
the sofa, saying laughingly, "Indeed the
madam will!"</p>

<p>His obsequious manner changed at
once, and he put his arm around her
waist with a happy sense of proprietorship.</p>

<p>The table was cosily laid for two, linen
and china were of the daintiest, and the
tiny kettle swung and bubbled merrily
over the alcohol lamp.</p>

<p>"How dear and homey it all is!" Katherine
exclaimed, as she sat down.</p>

<p>"And how primitive," suggested Robert.
"But our respective professions are not
worth much if our imaginations can't
change our tea into a banquet. Will you
have a little of the quail?" He poised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
a mutton chop on his fork and looked
inquiringly at Katherine.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid quail is too rich for me to-night,"
she answered, "but I will take a
little of the toast which is commonly
supposed to go with it, and some of the
nectar which I shall brew myself."</p>

<p>"Lucky thing you don't like cream with
your nectar," he responded, "for the cat
got into it this afternoon. I'm afraid
I neglect my housewifely duties for my art."</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter, as long as art
progresses. Did Mickey behave to-day?"</p>

<p>Mickey was the name Katherine had
given to Carroll's model, who was posing
for his "Aurora." She had the fair skin
and blue eyes with which Ireland compensates
her daughters for a somewhat
unlovely mouth, and her hair was a
flaming auburn glory which he tried in
vain to paint. It was a little startling
until you knew Mickey. People who could
pass hundreds without noting age, colour,
or condition of servitude, would stop and
gasp as she went by. But those who were
privileged to know her intimately became
so absorbed in contemplation of her manifold
character that mere externals were
passed unnoticed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mickey did pretty well to-day," he
said. "She put on your best hat while
I was out, and I found her strutting
before the mirror when I came back. I
declare to you, solemnly, Katherine, that
the effect of your violets against that hair
was absolutely <i>fortissimo</i>. She will wear
it to church some day if we don't watch
her. But she didn't cut my brushes into
scallops, nor assist in the painting when
my back was turned. No, on the whole
Mickey has been angelic. How did things
go with you?"</p>

<p>"About as usual, though I believe more
than the usual number of freaky people
have been in. They ask for everything
from money and advice, up to a letter of
introduction to the managing editor. They
seem to think that a woman tied down
to a newspaper desk, has only to beckon
and the universe hastens to do her bidding.
You remember I told you about the woman
who came in last week with a yearning
to do 'lit'ery work'?"</p>

<p>Robert nodded.</p>

<p>"She was in again to-day. She is
doing 'lit'ery work' and likes it very much.
What do you suppose it is?"</p>

<p>"Give it up."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>"Addressing envelopes! Did you ever?"</p>

<p>"Great idea," said Robert, "I'll tell
Mickey, and perhaps she'll clean my
brushes. Mickey shall be an artist."</p>

<p>Together they washed up the dishes,
then Robert hung the dish-towel out of
the window to dry, and took off his apron.</p>

<p>In the studio was an open fire, the single
extravagance which the Carrolls allowed
themselves. Perhaps it was not so extravagant
after all, since it saved gas,
and Robert picked up most of the wood
in his daily walks along the lake shore.</p>

<p>"Let's sit on the rug," said Katherine,
and they curled up like two children
before the fire. Robert rested his head
upon his elbow, and looked up contentedly
into her face. The sweetness of it was
half hidden, half revealed, by the dancing
firelight, but there were lines around the
mouth, and faint marks of worry on the
forehead. Yet, it was a patient face&mdash;one
to teach a man strength and kindliness.</p>

<p>The hand that wore the wedding ring
was thin, so thin that the ring slipped
when she moved her fingers. He touched
it tenderly.</p>

<p>"Dear, are you sorry?"</p>

<p>"Sorry! For what?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>"For all you left behind to marry a
poor artist."</p>

<p>"We leave nothing behind when we gain
happiness. Don't you think I'd rather
be here to-night with you, than to have the
money without you?"</p>

<p>Katherine's father had proved himself
the equal if not the superior of any stern
parent in fiction. A stormy scene followed
the announcement of her determination
to marry the man of her own choice,
rather than his, so they had slipped away
to Milwaukee&mdash;that haven of the fond and
foolish&mdash;and set up housekeeping immediately
on their return.</p>

<p>Robert had objected a little to the
announcement cards, since they were
not in a position to entertain, but they
were sent out. Upon the receipt of his,
Katherine's father had written a single
line: "Any time you may repent of
this foolishness, your home is open to you."</p>

<p>The avalanche of gifts had followed
the wedding instead of preceding it.
The usual miscellany of the very rich
had been showered upon them, and
Katherine had often thought of the
exquisite irony involved in the possession
of gold candlesticks, real laces, a Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
Worcester chocolate set, and a genuine
Corot, while her shoes were out at the toes
and Robert's clothes were sadly frayed.</p>

<p>Still, eight months had passed and she
had not repented of her foolishness.
He still seemed more desirable than
money, and she looked fondly at the Corot
which hung in the place of honour.</p>

<p>"I cleaned all the silver to-day," he
said, "and put our cut glass punch bowl
safely out of Mickey's reach."</p>

<p>She patted his cheek affectionately.</p>

<p>"You're a dear good boy, and an admirable
housekeeper."</p>

<p>"Katherine, I can't stand it any longer,"
he blurted out. "I simply won't stay
here and paint while you work your dear
fingers to the bone in that confounded
old office. It's my business to take care
of you, not yours of me, and here you are,
working like a slave, while I do the elegant
leisure at home. It's simply infamous!"</p>

<p>"Hubby, dear," and Katherine's tone
was commanding. "I won't let you abuse
yourself like that. In the first place you
are working just as hard as I am, with
your painting and keeping things cosy here,
and accomplishing just as much. And
it's only for a little while. As soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
your picture is done, you'll sell it, and I'll
resign and do the housekeeping myself.
You know how gladly you would do the
same for me; why won't you let me do it
for you? Don't you love me well enough
to let me help you?"</p>

<p>"Katherine! Katherine!" he cried,
"don't say that! Don't question my
love for you."</p>

<p>"I don't, dear heart, nor should you
question mine for you."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Long after Katherine had gone to bed,
he lay on the rug and watched the fire.
Outside, cold, gray Michigan beat against
the North Shore with the sound of the
sea. In these last days of despondency
the lake had grown into a companion
with seeming sympathy for every mood
of his. The vast expanse of water seemed
to broaden his horizon. Whenever he
looked at it, it suggested a letting-go of all
but the vital things. There was only
one thing that was vital, and she slept in
the little room beyond. Even his art
counted for nothing beside her, but she
believed in it, and he must make something
of it to please her. The shadows
deepened until even the gold candlesticks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
ceased to shine, and he went to the window.
Slow, sombre, and restless, old Michigan
chafed against the shore. At times those
cold arms beckoned him with compelling
strength, and it was so to-night. Katherine
would go home to her father, and, in
time, forget him. He pulled down the
shade, shuddering as he did so, and at
last fell asleep with a consciousness of
utter defeat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"It's busy I am these days. Misther
Carroll, do be afther wantin' to paint
me."</p>

<p>"Paint you, Carrot-Top! And thin
may the blessed saints injuce him to make
the hid of yez, some other colour."</p>

<p>"Ah, go on wid yez! What is the likes
of yez to know about art?"</p>

<p>It was Mickey in the yard below,
blarneying with the milk boy. The voices
awoke Carroll, and he discovered it was
very late, indeed, and that Katherine
had gone down-town without waking him.
There was a line pinned to the cushion:
"Good-bye, dearest. K."</p>

<p>Mickey appeared at the back door while
he was finishing his breakfast. With
unheard-of kindness, she offered to put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
things right in the studio, and he left her
in charge with some misgivings. But the
marketing had to be done, and it would
be impossible to work rightly without a
breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>When he returned every chair was set
demurely and properly against the wall
and Mickey sat on the floor with his
cherished portfolio of Gibson pictures
in her lap. He repressed an angry exclamation,
and ordered her, somewhat
sternly, to put them back.</p>

<p>She complied readily. "It's cross yez
are this morning, Misther Carroll. Thim
pictures ain't got no paint on 'em, but I'm
thinkin' they do be better wans than thim
ye're afther makin'!"</p>

<p>Carroll made no reply. It was quite
true that the Gibson pictures were better
than his, even without paint, but he did
not relish her impartial announcement of
the fact.</p>

<p>The light was good, and he worked
steadily for an hour, at the end of which
time Mickey announced the necessity
for her immediate departure. In vain
he protested and pleaded. The picture
was nearly done, and only a few more
sittings would be needed. But Mickey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
was "goin' to the theayter wid a coosin&mdash;"
and she went.</p>

<p>So he put the house in order and decided
he would make a cake for supper. He
had never done anything of the kind, and
Katherine found him still deep in the
problem when she returned. He couldn't
find the cook-book, he said, so he just
threw a few things in, the way she did
when she made cake. It was going to be
light too, for he had put in half a cupful
of baking powder. Katherine laughed
until the tears rolled down her cheeks.
It was a mean woman, Robert said, who
would go down-town and leave her husband
with no cook-book! She pointed it out
to him on the corner of the shelf, and
he twisted his mustache thoughtfully, forgetting
the flour with which his hand was
covered. It took them both to make him
presentable again, and then Katherine
threw the cake away, and in a very few
minutes made the lightest, most wonderful
biscuit that ever gave a man the dyspepsia.</p>

<p>Mickey was faithful during the following
week, and the "Aurora" was finished
almost to his satisfaction. It was placed
on sale in a Wabash Avenue gallery, and
they anxiously watched the newspapers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
for notices. None came, however, and
Robert became despondent. An idea came
to Katherine, and she went with fear and
trembling to the art critic of the <i>Express</i>,
whose judgment was accepted as law and
gospel.</p>

<p>Unlike most women she came to the
point at once: "Mr. Lester," she said,
"my husband has a picture on exhibition
at Stanley &amp; Brown's, and a favourable
notice would mean much to us both.
None of the papers have spoken of it,
and I have been wondering if you could
not help us a little."</p>

<p>Philosophers have not yet determined
why a woman feels free to ask anything
of a rejected lover, nor why men so willingly
grant favours to women whom they have
loved in vain.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Carroll," Lester replied, "I should
be only too glad to be of service to either
you or your husband, but I have seen
the picture, and I cannot conscientiously
speak favourably of it. In fact, I had
written a roast, and out of consideration
to you burned it up."</p>

<p>Katherine's face fell and her eyes filled.
He was afraid she was going to cry, and
he went on&mdash;"But I'll tell you what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
will do. I am called out of the city to-morrow,
and it is the day for my notes;
I'll ask Carleton to let you do my work.
You can write what you please."</p>

<p>She clutched the friendly straw gladly.
"You are very, very good. But please
tell me what is the matter with the
picture."</p>

<p>"Only one thing, Mrs. Carroll; it lacks
humanity. Pictures must be painted from
a human standpoint. No doubt you will
see what I mean if you will look at it
critically. I haven't time to stop any
longer now, but I'll tell Carleton."</p>

<p>An hour later, Katherine was summoned
to the office of the managing editor.
"Mrs. Carroll," he said, "Lester tells me
he is called out of the city and suggests
you as the proper person to do his work.
I believe it is a little out of your line, but
you can try. Miss Scott will do your
department to-day, and you can take
this afternoon to look around."</p>

<p>So the newly fledged art critic went
out to find her copy. There were several
pictures to be noted and she spoke as
kindly as she could of all, trying to mingle
helpful criticism with discerning praise.
None were condemned, for she knew what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
a picture might mean to the artist, and
to the woman who loved him.</p>

<p>Unconsciously, she imitated Lester's
style; his full, well-rounded periods, and
sharp, incisive sentences. Very different
it was from the chatty, gossipy way in
which she filled the "Woman's Kingdom,"
on the back page of the <i>Express</i>.</p>

<p>She was afraid to say too much of
Robert's work, and toned down her
enthusiasm three successive times. The
last note satisfied her and she sent it
up-stairs with the rest.</p>

<p>When the paper came in the morning,
he turned feverishly to the page which contained
the "Art of the Week." His shout
of joy woke Katherine and together they
laughed and cried over the "good notice."</p>

<p>She felt wicked, but his pleasure was
full compensation for her pangs of conscience.
"Lester's approval is worth a
thousand dollars," he said. "I can go
to work in earnest now."</p>

<p>Her face changed mysteriously. An
overwhelming sense of the wrong she had
done, came upon her, and he looked at
her steadily. There was a queer note in
his voice when he spoke: "Katherine
Carroll, I believe you wrote that notice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>It was useless to dissemble longer and
she told the whole story. He was deeply
touched by this proof of her devotion, but
he shook his head sadly over Lester's
own comment.</p>

<p>"It won't help any, little girl; you can't
make fame for me in that way. My work
must stand or fall on its own merits&mdash;and&mdash;it
seems likely to fall."</p>

<p>She tried to comfort him, but he put
her away. "No, it's all wrong. I'm
going to give it up, and try something else."</p>

<p>After she had gone, he put his easel and
paints away, and set the house in order.
Then he went into the city, as so many
have done before, to find work, which
seems little enough to ask in so great a
world. At five he returned, utterly tired
and cast down. He had tramped the
streets for hours and had found absolutely
nothing to do.</p>

<p>Half unconsciously, he turned to the
window&mdash;to the vision of the lake which
had meant strength before, but it brought
only weakness now. "Come,&mdash;come&mdash;come&mdash;"
the waves seemed to say&mdash;instead
of being cold and cruel, they were
promising infinite rest. And it meant
a luxurious home for Katherine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>His decision was quickly made, and he
wrote a tender note to leave for her.
He sobbed over that&mdash;for it wasn't like
painting&mdash;he was putting his heart into
it. Then down to the inland sea he went,
those impatient arms beckoning him still.</p>

<p>But Katherine had felt in the office that
something was wrong with Robert. A
pang of sudden fear made it impossible
for her to work any longer, and she hurried
home. She found the note at once, and
seeing only the "good-bye" at the end
she hastened to the door.</p>

<p>"Robert, Robert!" she called, but he
was too far away to hear her. And
Katherine ran, crying as she went, "Dear
God, make me in time!"</p>

<p>He stood at the end of the pier, old and
decayed as it was, and looked at the sea
and sky for the last time. The sunset
gates behind him, royally beautiful with
purple and gold, seemed a glimpse of
the heaven he hardly hoped to reach, for
though he knew that God was infinitely
merciful, he knew that He was also infinitely
just. He took off his coat and laid
it on the pier, just as Katherine, breathless,
excited, her face tense with appeal,
appeared beside him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>His eyes lighted for a moment at the
sight of her, then returned to their dull,
hopeless look. "It's no use, Katherine,"
he said unsteadily, "go back, darling."</p>

<p>"Not alone, dearest."</p>

<p>"Yes, Katherine," he kissed her sadly.</p>

<p>For minutes which seemed like hours,
she stood there arguing, pleading, begging
in vain. It was best for her&mdash;that was
his one thought. He was a dull, dead
weight upon her; it was right to make her
free. And the blue arms beckoned still.</p>

<p>Suddenly she drew his face down to hers
and whispered to him. What she said
seemed to rouse him from himself.</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes, really. Can you leave me now?"</p>

<p>Something more than the glory of the
sunset shone in Katherine's face as she
stood between him and the water. She
was subtly beautiful, with the infinite
motherhood, which lives in every woman's
heart, and as he looked at her, the shackles
of his dead cowardly self fell away. A
great resolve within him slowly swelled
into a controlling power&mdash;he would be
worthy of her who stood beside him, cost
what it might. His voice was tender and
caressing when he spoke again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>"Leave you? No, Katherine, no."</p>

<p>They walked home together and spoke
of other things. There was a stronger
bond between them, and the water seemed
cold and bitter now&mdash;very different from
the eerie, half-human thing that had
tempted him an hour ago.</p>

<p>He tossed restlessly through the night,
thinking of what Lester had said about
painting from a human standpoint.
Perhaps he meant that he should paint
men and women, instead of goddesses.</p>

<p>The vision of Katherine came into his
mind as she stood with the blue water
behind her and the sunset upon her face
and hair; her eyes full of earthly longing,
and more than earthly appeal. He would
paint her like that, and he roused from his
cowardly lethargy into high resolve.</p>

<p>Her salary was raised and she worked
happily at the office, while Robert painted
at home. In the evening she sat and sewed
on tiny garments for the human secret,
which spring was to reveal. He sat and
looked at her, seldom speaking, content
to watch the holy joy in her face, and
either that or his coming fatherhood,
sometimes thrilled him with a tenderness
so great that his love was almost joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>The "Aurora" had been sold, not for
a large sum, it is true, but for enough to
take care of them both until the new picture
should be finished. It was done at last
and placed on sale. Painted from a
human standpoint it undoubtedly was,
and it drew many admirers but no purchaser.
For four weeks it had been at
the gallery and Robert began to grow
despondent again.</p>

<p>A fall morning dawned, gray and dull,
and the lake seemed to tremble with
portent of coming disaster. At night the
wind rose and lashed the water into
seething foam. The sound of the storm
made Katherine afraid, but she sank into
a fitful slumber at last, while Robert kept
a light in the window, hoping none were
at sea.</p>

<p>But at half-past eleven there was a
terrific rap at the door. It was Mickey,
disheveled and breathless.</p>

<p>"There do be a wreck, Misther Carroll,"
she cried, "there's sky-rockets goin' off
and the life crew be ordered out, and I
thought ye'd be afther wantin' to see it."</p>

<p>The thing was evidently a circus for
Mickey; we hold life so lightly at the age
of sixteen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>Katherine, trembling and afraid, was
already at the door. She wrung her hands,
crying piteously, "Oh, Robert! Robert!
don't go."</p>

<p>"I must go, sweetheart, they may need
me."</p>

<p>"Then I am going too." And she began
to hurry into her clothes.</p>

<p>"Dress warmly, dear," he called.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will, and we must take some
blankets with us."</p>

<p>Once outside they had no difficulty
in locating the wreck. The northern
sky was aflame with rockets, and people
from all directions were hurrying northward.</p>

<p>The Northwestern University life crew
was already on the beach trying to shoot
a line to the sinking ship, half a mile from
the shore. The boat had been ordered
back, for it was certain death in such a
sea. The fourth attempt was successful
and a shout of joy went up, dimly heard
above the storm.</p>

<p>Mickey danced about excitedly as they
tied rope after rope of greater strength
to the slender cord, that had been shot
to the upper deck, but Katherine felt
faint, even with her husband's arm around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
her, when they made preparations to pull
the ship's life-boat ashore.</p>

<p>It required almost superhuman strength,
but the rush of water westward aided them
materially. Katherine never forgot that
time of waiting&mdash;human lives on shore
struggling to save the human lives at sea,
and the tense cruel crash of the cold waves.</p>

<p>Lifted high upon an angry crest, the
boat was dashed heavily upon the beach.
The captain of the stranded vessel, eight
seamen and one passenger, were helped
out with eager hands.</p>

<p>The passenger was a middle-aged man,
who appeared dignified and prosperous, in
spite of his damp and disheveled condition.
His first remark was in the nature of a
recapitulation.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the excitin' trips!"</p>

<p>Robert and Katherine laughed in spite
of themselves, and hastened to extend to
the stranger the hospitality of their little
home for the remainder of the night.
It was barely one o'clock, and the Honourable
Mr. Marchand accepted gladly, if
not gratefully.</p>

<p>He trudged sturdily along in the blankets
they had wrapped around him, disdaining
Robert's proffered assistance, but once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
stretched out upon their couch before a
blazing fire, he became much more tractable.
He called for a glass of whiskey
complaining that what he had been through
would be enough to kill him if he didn't
at once supply this long-felt want of the
inner man. A telephone message to the
nearest drug store brought the quart of
stimulant he thought he needed for the
night, and when he was comfortably filled
with his favourite beverage, life began
to assume a more pleasant aspect. He
graphically told the story of the wreck
to his interested listeners and then imbibed
a little more liquid nourishment. After
a while he remarked sagely&mdash;"It's a
lucky thing I didn't go down, some folks
would have lost millions."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" asked Katherine pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>millions</i>! Look here, young
woman, did you ever hear of a syndicate?"</p>

<p>Katherine thought she had heard the
word somewhere.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm one of 'em!"</p>

<p>The whiskey was evidently getting in
its work in the way of lubricating the
tongue of the shipwrecked capitalist, and
after waiting a moment, he continued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm on my way to Chicago to perfect
a combine in&mdash;" and he astounded Katherine
by unfolding the inside history of
a daring and infamous combination&mdash;a
gigantic steal, which if consummated, would
change the ownership of millions. He
named the leading conspirators, explained
the vulnerable points in the scheme, and
gleefully boasted of his own skill and
diplomacy.</p>

<p>He finally fell asleep, but not until
Katherine had got all the necessary points
concerning the outrageous robbery which
had been so adroitly planned.</p>

<p>Robert met her at the door. "Got a
scoop?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should say so. A big one too!"</p>

<p>"How do you know it is true?"</p>

<p>"<i>In vino veritas</i>," whispered Katherine.
"Besides, Carleton told one of our night
men the other day, that promotion was
in store for the fellow who 'got on to' any
of the schemes of this new syndicate."
She had heard so much newspaper slang
that her lapse from the grammatical standard
was perhaps pardonable.</p>

<p>Until nearly three o'clock she wrote hurriedly
a description of the wreck, and also of
the new "combine," Robert dozing in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
easy chair meanwhile. She woke him up
to give him her manuscript. "To the
telegraph office, quick! It'll be in time
for the city edition."</p>

<p>The Honourable Mr. Marchand slept
late the next morning, and Katharine
sent word to the office that she could not
come until the next day. About noon,
however, their guest took his departure,
apparently but little the worse for his vivid
night's experience. At a corner he bought
a copy of the morning's <i>Express</i> and
shortly thereafter leaned up against a wall
for support. "Gee whiz!" The Honourable
Mr. Marchand mopped his brow
and read the startling headlines again.
"Might as well go back to Cincinnati
and Cleveland and Toronto, and all them
towns I've just come from! Wonder
how in thunder the thing ever got out!"</p>

<p>He strolled down Wabash Avenue to
collect his scattered thoughts, and stopped
half mechanically, to look into Stanley
&amp; Brown's window. Carroll's painting
stared him full in the face, and a great
light broke in upon him.</p>

<p>"That's her! That's the girl what
done it! Blamed if I don't like her for it!"</p>

<p>That afternoon a messenger boy rapped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
at the studio door with a letter from the
<i>Express</i> office for Katherine.</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. Carroll," it ran, "we think
you deserve a two weeks' vacation at
full salary which is now double the former
sum, and we beg you to accept the enclosed
check as a slight testimonial of
our gratitude for the biggest scoop of
the year. Please report for duty on the
eighteenth, and be ready to take the
exchange editor's desk."</p>

<p>She was dazed. "Two weeks' vacation,
double salary, promotion, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Robert picked it up, it was a check for
two hundred dollars.</p>

<p>During the jubilation which followed,
a telegraph boy pounded vigorously at the
door, but he might as well have kept still,
since his efforts were unheard. Finally
he opened it, and utterly unabashed by
the spectacle of a gentleman kissing a
lady, and the lady seeming to enjoy it,
he fairly shrieked: "<span class="smcap">telegram</span>."</p>

<p>Katherine vanished instantly, and
Carroll read the despatch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Picture sold for highest price. Purchaser
unknown.</p>

<div class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Stanley &amp; Brown</span>."<br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>The mythical "quail on toast" became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
a reality that night, and the house seemed
far too small to hold so much exuberant
joy. In the morning, they went together
to Stanley &amp; Brown's to collect the picture
money, and start a "really truly bank
account," as Katherine said.</p>

<p>The firm was quite at a loss to know
who the purchaser was, as he took the
picture away with him in a carriage, and
paid cash instead of by check, but the man
who helped him put it on the back seat
of the carriage reported that he had
muttered to himself, as he was climbing in:
"That's her! That's the girl what done
it!" This may have given Mr. and Mrs.
Carroll some clue to the identity of the
unknown benefactor.</p>
